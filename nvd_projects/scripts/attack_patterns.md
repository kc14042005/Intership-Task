## AP-CVE-2017-3881 : CVE-2017-3881 Exploitation
Description: A vulnerability in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device or remotely execute code with elevated privileges. The Cluster Management Protocol utilizes Telnet internally as a signaling and command protocol between cluster members. The vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: (1) the failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device; and (2) the incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed CMP-specific Telnet options while establishing a Telnet session with an affected Cisco device configured to accept Telnet connections. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device.

## AP-CVE-2017-12319 : CVE-2017-12319 Exploitation
Description: A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over an Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) for Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or potentially corrupt the BGP routing table, which could result in network instability. The vulnerability exists due to changes in the implementation of the BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN RFC (RFC 7432) draft between IOS XE software releases. When the BGP Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route or BGP EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route update packet is received, it could be possible that the IP address length field is miscalculated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP packet to an affected device after the BGP session was established. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload or corrupt the BGP routing table; either outcome would result in a DoS. The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a crafted BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco IOS XE Software prior to software release 16.3 that support BGP EVPN configurations. If the device is not configured for EVPN, it is not vulnerable.

## AP-CVE-2023-50932 : CVE-2023-50932 Exploitation
Description: An issue was discovered in savignano S/Notify before 4.0.2 for Confluence. While an administrative user is logged on, the configuration settings of S/Notify can be modified via a CSRF attack. The injection could be initiated by the administrator clicking a malicious link in an email or by visiting a malicious website. If executed while an administrator is logged on to Confluence, an attacker could exploit this to modify the configuration of the S/Notify app on that host. This can, in particular, lead to email notifications being no longer encrypted when they should be.

## AP-CVE-2023-5123 : CVE-2023-5123 Exploitation
Description: The JSON datasource plugin ( https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/ ) is a Grafana Labs maintained plugin for Grafana that allows for retrieving and processing JSON data from a remote endpoint (including a specific sub-path) configured by an administrator. Due to inadequate sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter, it was possible to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and send requests to paths on the configured endpoint outside the configured sub-path. 





    
    
            






    
    
            This means that if the datasource was configured by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ ), it was possible for an editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which issues queries containing path traversal characters, which would in turn cause the datasource to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the configured domain (e.g.  https://example.com/api/admin_api/) .

In the rare case that this plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at the Grafana instance itself, this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe, as an administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be compelled to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints with their credentials, resulting in the potential for privilege escalation, hence the high score for this vulnerability.

## AP-CVE-2024-31210 : CVE-2024-31210 Exploitation
Description: WordPress is an open publishing platform for the Web. It's possible for a file of a type other than a zip file to be submitted as a new plugin by an administrative user on the Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin screen in WordPress. If FTP credentials are requested for installation (in order to move the file into place outside of the `uploads` directory) then the uploaded file remains temporary available in the Media Library despite it not being allowed. If the `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` constant is set to `true` on the site _and_ FTP credentials are required when uploading a new theme or plugin, then this technically allows an RCE when the user would otherwise have no means of executing arbitrary PHP code. This issue _only_ affects Administrator level users on single site installations, and Super Admin level users on Multisite installations where it's otherwise expected that the user does not have permission to upload or execute arbitrary PHP code. Lower level users are not affected. Sites where the `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` constant is set to `true` are not affected. Sites where an administrative user either does not need to enter FTP credentials or they have access to the valid FTP credentials, are not affected. The issue was fixed in WordPress 6.4.3 on January 30, 2024 and backported to versions 6.3.3, 6.2.4, 6.1.5, 6.0.7, 5.9.9, 5.8.9, 5.7.11, 5.6.13, 5.5.14, 5.4.15, 5.3.17, 5.2.20, 5.1.18, 5.0.21, 4.9.25, 2.8.24, 4.7.28, 4.6.28, 4.5.31, 4.4.32, 4.3.33, 4.2.37, and 4.1.40. A workaround is available. If the `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` constant is defined as `true` then it will not be possible for any user to upload a plugin and therefore this issue will not be exploitable.

## AP-CVE-2024-31205 : CVE-2024-31205 Exploitation
Description: Saleor is an e-commerce platform. Starting in version 3.10.0 and prior to versions 3.14.64, 3.15.39, 3.16.39, 3.17.35, 3.18.31, and 3.19.19, an attacker may bypass cross-set request forgery (CSRF) validation when calling refresh token mutation with empty string. When a user provides an empty string in `refreshToken` mutation, while the token persists in `JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME` cookie, application omits validation against CSRF token and returns valid access token. Versions 3.14.64, 3.15.39, 3.16.39, 3.17.35, 3.18.31, and 3.19.19 contain a patch for the issue. As a workaround, one may replace `saleor.graphql.account.mutations.authentication.refresh_token.py.get_refresh_token`. This will fix the issue, but be aware, that it returns `JWT_MISSING_TOKEN` instead of `JWT_INVALID_TOKEN`.

## AP-CVE-2024-32020 : CVE-2024-32020 Exploitation
Description: Git is a revision control system. Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's object database when source and target repository reside on the same disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user. Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a "proper" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future. The problem has been patched in versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4.

## AP-CVE-2024-37891 : CVE-2024-37891 Exploitation
Description:  urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.

Fix a use-after-free on dentry's d_fsdata fid list when a thread

The problem is that d_fsdata was not accessed under d_lock, because
d_release() normally is only called once the dentry is otherwise no
longer accessible but since we also call it explicitly in v9fs_remove
that lock is required:
move the hlist out of the dentry under lock then unref its fids once
they are no longer accessible.

## AP-CVE-2024-39496 : CVE-2024-39496 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: fix use-after-free due to race with dev replace

While loading a zone's info during creation of a block group, we can race
with a device replace operation and then trigger a use-after-free on the
device that was just replaced (source device of the replace operation).

This happens because at btrfs_load_zone_info() we extract a device from
the chunk map into a local variable and then use the device while not
under the protection of the device replace rwsem. So if there's a device
replace operation happening when we extract the device and that device
is the source of the replace operation, we will trigger a use-after-free
if before we finish using the device the replace operation finishes and
frees the device.

Fix this by enlarging the critical section under the protection of the
device replace rwsem so that all uses of the device are done inside the
critical section.

## AP-CVE-2021-1379 : CVE-2021-1379 Exploitation
Description: Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementations for Cisco&nbsp;IP Phone Series 68xx/78xx/88xx could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP phone.
These vulnerabilities are due to missing checks when the IP phone processes a Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet to the targeted IP phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP phone or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.Note: Cisco&nbsp;Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).Cisco&nbsp;has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.

## AP-CVE-2024-56644 : CVE-2024-56644 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/ipv6: release expired exception dst cached in socket

Dst objects get leaked in ip6_negative_advice() when this function is
executed for an expired IPv6 route located in the exception table. There
are several conditions that must be fulfilled for the leak to occur:
* an ICMPv6 packet indicating a change of the MTU for the path is received,
  resulting in an exception dst being created
* a TCP connection that uses the exception dst for routing packets must
  start timing out so that TCP begins retransmissions
* after the exception dst expires, the FIB6 garbage collector must not run
  before TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for the expired exception dst

When TCP executes ip6_negative_advice() for an exception dst that has
expired and if no other socket holds a reference to the exception dst, the
refcount of the exception dst is 2, which corresponds to the increment
made by dst_init() and the increment made by the TCP socket for which the
connection is timing out. The refcount made by the socket is never
released. The refcount of the dst is decremented in sk_dst_reset() but
that decrement is counteracted by a dst_hold() intentionally placed just
before the sk_dst_reset() in ip6_negative_advice(). After
ip6_negative_advice() has finished, there is no other object tied to the
dst. The socket lost its reference stored in sk_dst_cache and the dst is
no longer in the exception table. The exception dst becomes a leaked
object.

As a result of this dst leak, an unbalanced refcount is reported for the
loopback device of a net namespace being destroyed under kernels that do
not contain e5f80fcf869a ("ipv6: give an IPv6 dev to blackhole_netdev"):
unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 2

Fix the dst leak by removing the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice(). The
patch that introduced the dst_hold() in ip6_negative_advice() was
92f1655aa2b22 ("net: fix __dst_negative_advice() race"). But 92f1655aa2b22
merely refactored the code with regards to the dst refcount so the issue
was present even before 92f1655aa2b22. The bug was introduced in
54c1a859efd9f ("ipv6: Don't drop cache route entry unless timer actually
expired.") where the expired cached route is deleted and the sk_dst_cache
member of the socket is set to NULL by calling dst_negative_advice() but
the refcount belonging to the socket is left unbalanced.

The IPv4 version - ipv4_negative_advice() - is not affected by this bug.
When the TCP connection times out ipv4_negative_advice() merely resets the
sk_dst_cache of the socket while decrementing the refcount of the
exception dst.

   https://xapi-project.github.io/xen-api/overview.html#object-model-overview 

Xapi contains functionality to backup and restore metadata about Virtual
Machines and Storage Repositories (SRs).

The metadata itself is stored in a Virtual Disk Image (VDI) inside an
SR.  This is used for two purposes; a general backup of metadata
(e.g. to recover from a host failure if the filer is still good), and
Portable SRs (e.g. using an external hard drive to move VMs to another
host).

Metadata is only restored as an explicit administrator action, but
occurs in cases where the host has no information about the SR, and must
locate the metadata VDI in order to retrieve the metadata.

The metadata VDI is located by searching (in UUID alphanumeric order)
each VDI, mounting it, and seeing if there is a suitable metadata file
present.  The first matching VDI is deemed to be the metadata VDI, and
is restored from.

In the general case, the content of VDIs are controlled by the VM owner,
and should not be trusted by the host administrator.

A malicious guest can manipulate its disk to appear to be a metadata
backup.

A guest cannot choose the UUIDs of its VDIs, but a guest with one disk
has a 50% chance of sorting ahead of the legitimate metadata backup.  A
guest with two disks has a 75% chance, etc.

## AP-CVE-2024-57982 : CVE-2024-57982 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: state: fix out-of-bounds read during lookup

lookup and resize can run in parallel.

The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock ensures a retry, but the hash
functions can observe a hmask value that is too large for the new hlist
array.

rehash does:
  rcu_assign_pointer(net->xfrm.state_bydst, ndst) [..]
  net->xfrm.state_hmask = nhashmask;

While state lookup does:
  h = xfrm_dst_hash(net, daddr, saddr, tmpl->reqid, encap_family);
  hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(x, net->xfrm.state_bydst + h, bydst) {

This is only safe in case the update to state_bydst is larger than
net->xfrm.xfrm_state_hmask (or if the lookup function gets
serialized via state spinlock again).

Fix this by prefetching state_hmask and the associated pointers.
The xfrm_state_hash_generation seqlock retry will ensure that the pointer
and the hmask will be consistent.

The existing helpers, like xfrm_dst_hash(), are now unsafe for RCU side,
add lockdep assertions to document that they are only safe for insert
side.

xfrm_state_lookup_byaddr() uses the spinlock rather than RCU.
AFAICS this is an oversight from back when state lookup was converted to
RCU, this lock should be replaced with RCU in a future patch.

## AP-CVE-2025-0689 : CVE-2025-0689 Exploitation
Description: When reading data from disk, the grub's UDF filesystem module utilizes the user controlled data length metadata to allocate its internal buffers. In certain scenarios, while iterating through disk sectors, it assumes the read size from the disk is always smaller than the allocated buffer size which is not guaranteed. A crafted filesystem image may lead to a heap-based buffer overflow resulting in critical data to be corrupted, resulting in the risk of arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.

## AP-CVE-2025-1125 : CVE-2025-1125 Exploitation
Description: When reading data from a hfs filesystem, grub's hfs filesystem module uses user-controlled parameters from the filesystem metadata to calculate the internal buffers size, however it misses to properly check for integer overflows. A maliciouly crafted filesystem may lead some of those buffer size calculation to overflow, causing it to perform a grub_malloc() operation with a smaller size than expected. As a result the hfsplus_open_compressed_real() function will write past of the internal buffer length. This flaw may be leveraged to corrupt grub's internal critical data and may result in arbitrary code execution by-passing secure boot protections.

## AP-CVE-2025-22022 : CVE-2025-22022 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Apply the link chain quirk on NEC isoc endpoints

Two clearly different specimens of NEC uPD720200 (one with start/stop
bug, one without) were seen to cause IOMMU faults after some Missed
Service Errors. Faulting address is immediately after a transfer ring
segment and patched dynamic debug messages revealed that the MSE was
received when waiting for a TD near the end of that segment:

[ 1.041954] xhci_hcd: Miss service interval error for slot 1 ep 2 expected TD DMA ffa08fe0
[ 1.042120] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09000 flags=0x0000]
[ 1.042146] xhci_hcd: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0005 address=0xffa09040 flags=0x0000]

It gets even funnier if the next page is a ring segment accessible to
the HC. Below, it reports MSE in segment at ff1e8000, plows through a
zero-filled page at ff1e9000 and starts reporting events for TRBs in
page at ff1ea000 every microframe, instead of jumping to seg ff1e6000.

[ 7.098379] xhci_hcd: Overrun event on slot 1 ep 2

It's possible that data from the isochronous device were written to
random buffers of pending TDs on other endpoints (either IN or OUT),
other devices or even other HCs in the same IOMMU domain.

Lastly, an error from a different USB device on another HC. Was it
caused by the above? I don't know, but it may have been. The disk
was working without any other issues and generated PCIe traffic to
starve the NEC of upstream BW and trigger those MSEs. The two HCs
shared one x1 slot by means of a commercial "PCIe splitter" board.

[ 7.162604] usb 10-2: reset SuperSpeed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd

[ 7.179004] I/O error, dev sdb, sector 67284480 op 0x0:(READ) flags 0x80700 phys_seg 5 prio class 0

Fortunately, it appears that this ridiculous bug is avoided by setting
the chain bit of Link TRBs on isochronous rings. Other ancient HCs are
known which also expect the bit to be set and they ignore Link TRBs if
it's not. Reportedly, 0.95 spec guaranteed that the bit is set.

The bandwidth-starved NEC HC running a 32KB/uframe UVC endpoint reports
tens of MSEs per second and runs into the bug within seconds. Chaining
Link TRBs allows the same workload to run for many minutes, many times.

## AP-CVE-2025-22090 : CVE-2025-22090 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()

If track_pfn_copy() fails, we already added the dst VMA to the maple
tree. As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over
the dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied
any page tables.

Consequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the
PAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page
table was not copied.

The easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA
if track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about "simply"
clearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()
and performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll
simply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...
which is also wrong.

So let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation
succeeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if
anything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT
flag after undoing the reservation.

Note that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will
get removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set
then, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be
happy. Note that leaving these page tables in place without a reservation
is not a problem, as we are aborting fork(); this process will never run.

A reproducer can trigger this usually at the first try:

... and instead of undoing the reservation we simply cleared the VM_PAT flag.

Keep the documentation of these functions in include/linux/pgtable.h,
one place is more than sufficient -- we should clean that up for the other
functions like track_pfn_remap/untrack_pfn separately.

## AP-CVE-2025-22107 : CVE-2025-22107 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: sja1105: fix kasan out-of-bounds warning in sja1105_table_delete_entry()

There are actually 2 problems:
- deleting the last element doesn't require the memmove of elements
  [i + 1, end) over it. Actually, element i+1 is out of bounds.
- The memmove itself should move size - i - 1 elements, because the last
  element is out of bounds.

The out-of-bounds element still remains out of bounds after being
accessed, so the problem is only that we touch it, not that it becomes
in active use. But I suppose it can lead to issues if the out-of-bounds
element is part of an unmapped page.

## AP-CVE-2025-22111 : CVE-2025-22111 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: Remove RTNL dance for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.

SIOCBRDELIF is passed to dev_ioctl() first and later forwarded to
br_ioctl_call(), which causes unnecessary RTNL dance and the splat
below [0] under RTNL pressure.

Let's say Thread A is trying to detach a device from a bridge and
Thread B is trying to remove the bridge.

In dev_ioctl(), Thread A bumps the bridge device's refcnt by
netdev_hold() and releases RTNL because the following br_ioctl_call()
also re-acquires RTNL.

In the race window, Thread B could acquire RTNL and try to remove
the bridge device.  Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL
and wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.

Thread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(),
which may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by
Thread B.

                                                and log splat below

To avoid blocking SIOCBRDELBR unnecessarily, let's not call
dev_ioctl() for SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF.

In the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:

  1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()
  2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()
  3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()
  4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()

3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move
1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().

Note that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better
performed before RTNL.

SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since
the pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process
them there.

## AP-CVE-2025-46712 : CVE-2025-46712 Exploitation
Description: Erlang/OTP is a set of libraries for the Erlang programming language. In versions prior to OTP-27.3.4 (for OTP-27), OTP-26.2.5.12 (for OTP-26), and OTP-25.3.2.21 (for OTP-25), Erlang/OTP SSH fails to enforce strict KEX handshake hardening measures by allowing optional messages to be exchanged. This allows a Man-in-the-Middle attacker to inject these messages in a connection during the handshake. This issue has been patched in versions OTP-27.3.4 (for OTP-27), OTP-26.2.5.12 (for OTP-26), and OTP-25.3.2.21 (for OTP-25).

## AP-CVE-2025-4598 : CVE-2025-4598 Exploitation
Description: A vulnerability was found in systemd-coredump. This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.

A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to. An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.

This problem is similar to the problem that the
commit 1d6a9e7449e2 ("RDMA/core: Fix use-after-free when rename device name")
fixes.

The root cause is: the function ib_device_rename() renames the name with
lock. But in the function kobject_uevent(), this name is accessed without
lock protection at the same time.

The solution is to add the lock protection when this name is accessed in
the function kobject_uevent().

## AP-CVE-2025-52560 : CVE-2025-52560 Exploitation
Description: Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. Prior to version 1.2.46, Kanboard allows password reset emails to be sent with URLs derived from the unvalidated Host header when the application_url configuration is unset (default behavior). This allows an attacker to craft a malicious password reset link that leaks the token to an attacker-controlled domain. If a victim (including an administrator) clicks the poisoned link, their account can be taken over. This affects all users who initiate a password reset while application_url is not set. This issue has been patched in version 1.2.46.

page_pool can be free while page pool recycle the last page in ring.
Add producer-lock barrier to page_pool_release to prevent the page
pool from being free before all pages have been recycled.

recycle_stat_inc() is empty when CONFIG_PAGE_POOL_STATS is not
enabled, which will trigger Wempty-body build warning. Add definition
for pool stat macro to fix warning.

## AP-CVE-2025-5351 : CVE-2025-5351 Exploitation
Description: A flaw was found in the key export functionality of libssh. The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.

## AP-CVE-2025-38234 : CVE-2025-38234 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/rt: Fix race in push_rt_task

Overview
========
When a CPU chooses to call push_rt_task and picks a task to push to
another CPU's runqueue then it will call find_lock_lowest_rq method
which would take a double lock on both CPUs' runqueues. If one of the
locks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current
runqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window
it is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some
other CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is
migrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to
wake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue
(on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the
current checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no
longer in the pushable tasks list.

Crashes
=======
This bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel
panics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page
faults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all
coming from scheduler itself.

Some of the crashes:

## AP-CVE-2025-27465 : CVE-2025-27465 Exploitation
Description: Certain instructions need intercepting and emulating by Xen.  In some
cases Xen emulates the instruction by replaying it, using an executable
stub.  Some instructions may raise an exception, which is supposed to be
handled gracefully.  Certain replayed instructions have additional logic
to set up and recover the changes to the arithmetic flags.

For replayed instructions where the flags recovery logic is used, the
metadata for exception handling was incorrect, preventing Xen from
handling the the exception gracefully, treating it as fatal instead.

## AP-CVE-2025-38352 : CVE-2025-38352 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-cpu-timers: fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()

If an exiting non-autoreaping task has already passed exit_notify() and
calls handle_posix_cpu_timers() from IRQ, it can be reaped by its parent
or debugger right after unlock_task_sighand().

If a concurrent posix_cpu_timer_del() runs at that moment, it won't be
able to detect timer->it.cpu.firing != 0: cpu_timer_task_rcu() and/or
lock_task_sighand() will fail.

Add the tsk->exit_state check into run_posix_cpu_timers() to fix this.

This fix is not needed if CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK=y, because
exit_task_work() is called before exit_notify(). But the check still
makes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work) will fail
anyway in this case.

## AP-CVE-2025-38480 : CVE-2025-38480 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fix use of uninitialized data in insn_rw_emulate_bits()

For Comedi `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions on "digital"
subdevices (subdevice types `COMEDI_SUBD_DI`, `COMEDI_SUBD_DO`, and
`COMEDI_SUBD_DIO`), it is common for the subdevice driver not to have
`insn_read` and `insn_write` handler functions, but to have an
`insn_bits` handler function for handling Comedi `INSN_BITS`
instructions.  In that case, the subdevice's `insn_read` and/or
`insn_write` function handler pointers are set to point to the
`insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function by `__comedi_device_postconfig()`.

For `INSN_WRITE`, `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently assumes that the
supplied `data[0]` value is a valid copy from user memory.  It will at
least exist because `do_insnlist_ioctl()` and `do_insn_ioctl()` in
"comedi_fops.c" ensure at lease `MIN_SAMPLES` (16) elements are
allocated.  However, if `insn->n` is 0 (which is allowable for
`INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions, then `data[0]` may contain
uninitialized data, and certainly contains invalid data, possibly from a
different instruction in the array of instructions handled by
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`.  This will result in an incorrect value being
written to the digital output channel (or to the digital input/output
channel if configured as an output), and may be reflected in the
internal saved state of the channel.

Fix it by returning 0 early if `insn->n` is 0, before reaching the code
that accesses `data[0]`.  Previously, the function always returned 1 on
success, but it is supposed to be the number of data samples actually
read or written up to `insn->n`, which is 0 in this case.

## AP-CVE-2025-38481 : CVE-2025-38481 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fail COMEDI_INSNLIST ioctl if n_insns is too large

The handling of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST` ioctl allocates a kernel buffer to
hold the array of `struct comedi_insn`, getting the length from the
`n_insns` member of the `struct comedi_insnlist` supplied by the user.
The allocation will fail with a WARNING and a stack dump if it is too
large.

Avoid that by failing with an `-EINVAL` error if the supplied `n_insns`
value is unreasonable.

Define the limit on the `n_insns` value in the `MAX_INSNS` macro.  Set
this to the same value as `MAX_SAMPLES` (65536), which is the maximum
allowed sum of the values of the member `n` in the array of `struct
comedi_insn`, and sensible comedi instructions will have an `n` of at
least 1.

## AP-CVE-2025-38488 : CVE-2025-38488 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix use-after-free in crypt_message when using async crypto

The CVE-2024-50047 fix removed asynchronous crypto handling from
crypt_message(), assuming all crypto operations are synchronous.
However, when hardware crypto accelerators are used, this can cause
use-after-free crashes:

  crypt_message()
    // Allocate the creq buffer containing the req
    creq = smb2_get_aead_req(..., &req);

    // Async encryption returns -EINPROGRESS immediately
    rc = enc ? crypto_aead_encrypt(req) : crypto_aead_decrypt(req);

    // Free creq while async operation is still in progress
    kvfree_sensitive(creq, ...);

Hardware crypto modules often implement async AEAD operations for
performance. When crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS,
the operation completes asynchronously. Without crypto_wait_req(),
the function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes
when the driver later accesses the freed memory.

This results in a use-after-free condition when the hardware crypto
driver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel
crashes with NULL pointer dereferences.

The issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with mask=0 doesn't
guarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in
the mask, async implementations can be selected.

Fix by restoring the async crypto handling:
- DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait) for completion tracking
- aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification
- crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion

This ensures the request buffer isn't freed until the crypto operation
completes, whether synchronous or asynchronous, while preserving the
CVE-2024-50047 fix.

## AP-CVE-2025-8419 : CVE-2025-8419 Exploitation
Description: A vulnerability was found in Keycloak-services. Special characters used during e-mail registration may perform SMTP Injection and unexpectedly send short unwanted e-mails. The email is limited to 64 characters (limited local part of the email), so the attack is limited to very shorts emails (subject and little data, the example is 60 chars). This flaw's only direct consequence is an unsolicited email being sent from the Keycloak server. However, this action could be a precursor for more sophisticated attacks.

## AP-CVE-2025-7195 : CVE-2025-7195 Exploitation
Description: Early versions of Operator-SDK provided an insecure method to allow operator containers to run in environments that used a random UID. Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 provided a script, user_setup, which modifies the permissions of the /etc/passwd file to 664 during build time. Developers who used Operator-SDK before 0.15.2 to scaffold their operator may still be impacted by this if the insecure user_setup script is still being used to build new container images. 

In affected images, the /etc/passwd file is created during build time with group-writable permissions and a group ownership of root (gid=0). An attacker who can execute commands within an affected container, even as a non-root user, may be able to leverage their membership in the root group to modify the /etc/passwd file. This could allow the attacker to add a new user with any arbitrary UID, including UID 0, leading to full root privileges within the container.

## AP-CVE-2025-38499 : CVE-2025-38499 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clone_private_mnt(): make sure that caller has CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the right userns

What we want is to verify there is that clone won't expose something
hidden by a mount we wouldn't be able to undo.  "Wouldn't be able to undo"
may be a result of MNT_LOCKED on a child, but it may also come from
lacking admin rights in the userns of the namespace mount belongs to.

clone_private_mnt() checks the former, but not the latter.

There's a number of rather confusing CAP_SYS_ADMIN checks in various
userns during the mount, especially with the new mount API; they serve
different purposes and in case of clone_private_mnt() they usually,
but not always end up covering the missing check mentioned above.

## AP-CVE-2025-38500 : CVE-2025-38500 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: interface: fix use-after-free after changing collect_md xfrm interface

collect_md property on xfrm interfaces can only be set on device creation,
thus xfrmi_changelink() should fail when called on such interfaces.

The check to enforce this was done only in the case where the xi was
returned from xfrmi_locate() which doesn't look for the collect_md
interface, and thus the validation was never reached.

Calling changelink would thus errornously place the special interface xi
in the xfrmi_net->xfrmi hash, but since it also exists in the
xfrmi_net->collect_md_xfrmi pointer it would lead to a double free when
the net namespace was taken down [1].

Change the check to use the xi from netdev_priv which is available earlier
in the function to prevent changes in xfrm collect_md interfaces.

## AP-CVE-2025-38502 : CVE-2025-38502 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix oob access in cgroup local storage

Lonial reported that an out-of-bounds access in cgroup local storage
can be crafted via tail calls. Given two programs each utilizing a
cgroup local storage with a different value size, and one program
doing a tail call into the other. The verifier will validate each of
the indivial programs just fine. However, in the runtime context
the bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains the
BPF program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the program
uses. Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the
runtime context:

  ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);
  storage = ctx->prog_item->cgroup_storage[stype];

  if (stype == BPF_CGROUP_STORAGE_SHARED)
    ptr = &READ_ONCE(storage->buf)->data[0];
  else
    ptr = this_cpu_ptr(storage->percpu_buf);

For the second program which was called from the originally attached
one, this means bpf_get_local_storage() will pick up the former
program's map, not its own. With mismatching sizes, this can result
in an unintended out-of-bounds access.

To fix this issue, we need to extend bpf_map_owner with an array of
storage_cookie[] to match on i) the exact maps from the original
program if the second program was using bpf_get_local_storage(), or
ii) allow the tail call combination if the second program was not
using any of the cgroup local storage maps.

## AP-CVE-2025-38512 : CVE-2025-38512 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: prevent A-MSDU attacks in mesh networks

This patch is a mitigation to prevent the A-MSDU spoofing vulnerability
for mesh networks. The initial update to the IEEE 802.11 standard, in
response to the FragAttacks, missed this case (CVE-2025-27558). It can
be considered a variant of CVE-2020-24588 but for mesh networks.

This patch tries to detect if a standard MSDU was turned into an A-MSDU
by an adversary. This is done by parsing a received A-MSDU as a standard
MSDU, calculating the length of the Mesh Control header, and seeing if
the 6 bytes after this header equal the start of an rfc1042 header. If
equal, this is a strong indication of an ongoing attack attempt.

This defense was tested with mac80211_hwsim against a mesh network that
uses an empty Mesh Address Extension field, i.e., when four addresses
are used, and when using a 12-byte Mesh Address Extension field, i.e.,
when six addresses are used. Functionality of normal MSDUs and A-MSDUs
was also tested, and confirmed working, when using both an empty and
12-byte Mesh Address Extension field.

It was also tested with mac80211_hwsim that A-MSDU attacks in non-mesh
networks keep being detected and prevented.

Note that the vulnerability being patched, and the defense being
implemented, was also discussed in the following paper and in the
following IEEE 802.11 presentation:

## AP-CVE-2025-38513 : CVE-2025-38513 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: zd1211rw: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in zd_mac_tx_to_dev()

There is a potential NULL pointer dereference in zd_mac_tx_to_dev(). For
example, the following is possible:

    	T0			    		T1
zd_mac_tx_to_dev()
  /* len == skb_queue_len(q) */
  while (len > ZD_MAC_MAX_ACK_WAITERS) {

					  filter_ack()
					    spin_lock_irqsave(&q->lock, flags);
					    /* position == skb_queue_len(q) */
					    for (i=1; i<position; i++)
				    	      skb = __skb_dequeue(q)

					    if (mac->type == NL80211_IFTYPE_AP)
					      skb = __skb_dequeue(q);
					    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&q->lock, flags);

    skb_dequeue() -> NULL

Since there is a small gap between checking skb queue length and skb being
unconditionally dequeued in zd_mac_tx_to_dev(), skb_dequeue() can return NULL.
Then the pointer is passed to zd_mac_tx_status() where it is dereferenced.

In order to avoid potential NULL pointer dereference due to situations like
above, check if skb is not NULL before passing it to zd_mac_tx_status().

## AP-CVE-2025-38515 : CVE-2025-38515 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/sched: Increment job count before swapping tail spsc queue

A small race exists between spsc_queue_push and the run-job worker, in
which spsc_queue_push may return not-first while the run-job worker has
already idled due to the job count being zero. If this race occurs, job
scheduling stops, leading to hangs while waiting on the job’s DMA
fences.

Seal this race by incrementing the job count before appending to the
SPSC queue.

This race was observed on a drm-tip 6.16-rc1 build with the Xe driver in
an SVM test case.

## AP-CVE-2025-38516 : CVE-2025-38516 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: qcom: msm: mark certain pins as invalid for interrupts

On some platforms, the UFS-reset pin has no interrupt logic in TLMM but
is nevertheless registered as a GPIO in the kernel. This enables the
user-space to trigger a BUG() in the pinctrl-msm driver by running, for
example: `gpiomon -c 0 113` on RB2.

The exact culprit is requesting pins whose intr_detection_width setting
is not 1 or 2 for interrupts. This hits a BUG() in
msm_gpio_irq_set_type(). Potentially crashing the kernel due to an
invalid request from user-space is not optimal, so let's go through the
pins and mark those that would fail the check as invalid for the irq chip
as we should not even register them as available irqs.

This function can be extended if we determine that there are more
corner-cases like this.

## AP-CVE-2025-38520 : CVE-2025-38520 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Don't call mmput from MMU notifier callback

If the process is exiting, the mmput inside mmu notifier callback from
compactd or fork or numa balancing could release the last reference
of mm struct to call exit_mmap and free_pgtable, this triggers deadlock
with below backtrace.

The deadlock will leak kfd process as mmu notifier release is not called
and cause VRAM leaking.

The fix is to take mm reference mmget_non_zero when adding prange to the
deferred list to pair with mmput in deferred list work.

If prange split and add into pchild list, the pchild work_item.mm is not
used, so remove the mm parameter from svm_range_unmap_split and
svm_range_add_child.

The backtrace of hung task:

## AP-CVE-2025-38527 : CVE-2025-38527 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix use-after-free in cifs_oplock_break

A race condition can occur in cifs_oplock_break() leading to a
use-after-free of the cinode structure when unmounting:

  cifs_oplock_break()
    _cifsFileInfo_put(cfile)
      cifsFileInfo_put_final()
        cifs_sb_deactive()
          [last ref, start releasing sb]
            kill_sb()
              kill_anon_super()
                generic_shutdown_super()
                  evict_inodes()
                    dispose_list()
                      evict()
                        destroy_inode()
                          call_rcu(&inode->i_rcu, i_callback)
    spin_lock(&cinode->open_file_lock)  <- OK
                            [later] i_callback()
                              cifs_free_inode()
                                kmem_cache_free(cinode)
    spin_unlock(&cinode->open_file_lock)  <- UAF
    cifs_done_oplock_break(cinode)       <- UAF

The issue occurs when umount has already released its reference to the
superblock. When _cifsFileInfo_put() calls cifs_sb_deactive(), this
releases the last reference, triggering the immediate cleanup of all
inodes under RCU. However, cifs_oplock_break() continues to access the
cinode after this point, resulting in use-after-free.

Fix this by holding an extra reference to the superblock during the
entire oplock break operation. This ensures that the superblock and
its inodes remain valid until the oplock break completes.

## AP-CVE-2025-38528 : CVE-2025-38528 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Reject %p% format string in bprintf-like helpers

static const char fmt[] = "%p%";
    bpf_trace_printk(fmt, sizeof(fmt));

The above BPF program isn't rejected and causes a kernel warning at
runtime:

    Please remove unsupported %\x00 in format string
    WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7244 at lib/vsprintf.c:2680 format_decode+0x49c/0x5d0

This happens because bpf_bprintf_prepare skips over the second %,
detected as punctuation, while processing %p. This patch fixes it by
not skipping over punctuation. %\x00 is then processed in the next
iteration and rejected.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

When checking for a supported IRQ number, the following test is used:

	if ((1 << it->options[1]) & 0xdcfc) {

However, `it->options[i]` is an unchecked `int` value from userspace, so
the shift amount could be negative or out of bounds.  Fix the test by
requiring `it->options[1]` to be within bounds before proceeding with
the original test.  Valid `it->options[1]` values that select the IRQ
will be in the range [1,15]. The value 0 explicitly disables the use of

## AP-CVE-2025-38535 : CVE-2025-38535 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: tegra: xusb: Fix unbalanced regulator disable in UTMI PHY mode

When transitioning from USB_ROLE_DEVICE to USB_ROLE_NONE, the code
assumed that the regulator should be disabled. However, if the regulator
is marked as always-on, regulator_is_enabled() continues to return true,
leading to an incorrect attempt to disable a regulator which is not
enabled.

This can result in warnings such as:

[  250.155624] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7326 at drivers/regulator/core.c:3004
_regulator_disable+0xe4/0x1a0
[  250.155652] unbalanced disables for VIN_SYS_5V0

To fix this, we move the regulator control logic into
tegra186_xusb_padctl_id_override() function since it's directly related
to the ID override state. The regulator is now only disabled when the role
transitions from USB_ROLE_HOST to USB_ROLE_NONE, by checking the VBUS_ID
register. This ensures that regulator enable/disable operations are
properly balanced and only occur when actually transitioning to/from host
mode.

## AP-CVE-2025-38538 : CVE-2025-38538 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: nbpfaxi: Fix memory corruption in probe()

The nbpf->chan[] array is allocated earlier in the nbpf_probe() function
and it has "num_channels" elements.  These three loops iterate one
element farther than they should and corrupt memory.

The changes to the second loop are more involved.  In this case, we're
copying data from the irqbuf[] array into the nbpf->chan[] array.  If
the data in irqbuf[i] is the error IRQ then we skip it, so the iterators
are not in sync.  I added a check to ensure that we don't go beyond the
end of the irqbuf[] array.  I'm pretty sure this can't happen, but it
seemed harmless to add a check.

On the other hand, after the loop has ended there is a check to ensure
that the "chan" iterator is where we expect it to be.  In the original
code we went one element beyond the end of the array so the iterator
wasn't in the correct place and it would always return -EINVAL.  However,
now it will always be in the correct place.  I deleted the check since
we know the result.

## AP-CVE-2025-38539 : CVE-2025-38539 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Add down_write(trace_event_sem) when adding trace event

When a module is loaded, it adds trace events defined by the module. It
may also need to modify the modules trace printk formats to replace enum
names with their values.

If two modules are loaded at the same time, the adding of the event to the
ftrace_events list can corrupt the walking of the list in the code that is
modifying the printk format strings and crash the kernel.

The addition of the event should take the trace_event_sem for write while
it adds the new event.

Also add a lockdep_assert_held() on that semaphore in
__trace_add_event_dirs() as it iterates the list.

The code assumes that vcc_destroy_socket() passes NULL skb

frees clip_vcc.

However, ioctl(ATMARPD_CTRL) sets NULL to vcc->push() in
atm_init_atmarp(), resulting in memory leak.

Let's serialise two ioctl() by lock_sock() and check vcc->push()
in atm_init_atmarp() to prevent memleak.

We have races similar to the one addressed by the previous patch between
subflow failing and additional subflow creation. They are just harder to
trigger.

The solution is similar. Use a separate flag to track the condition
'socket state prevent any additional subflow creation' protected by the
fallback lock.

The socket fallback makes such flag true, and also receiving or sending
an MP_FAIL option.

The field 'allow_infinite_fallback' is now always touched under the
relevant lock, we can drop the ONCE annotation on write.

## AP-CVE-2025-38553 : CVE-2025-38553 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree

netem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netem
resides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a
soft lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].
Ensure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with other
netems.

Previous approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:

1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Considered
too specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would
be a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future
DOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].

2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a
per cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its
child, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a
netem.

3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb
to handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement
in duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal
notes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this
safeguard.

4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral
path contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a
packet to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem
duplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a
duplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix Preauh_HashValue race condition

If client send multiple session setup requests to ksmbd,
Preauh_HashValue race condition could happen.
There is no need to free sess->Preauh_HashValue at session setup phase.
It can be freed together with session at connection termination phase.

## AP-CVE-2025-38563 : CVE-2025-38563 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Prevent VMA split of buffer mappings

The perf mmap code is careful about mmap()'ing the user page with the
ringbuffer and additionally the auxiliary buffer, when the event supports
it. Once the first mapping is established, subsequent mapping have to use
the same offset and the same size in both cases. The reference counting for
the ringbuffer and the auxiliary buffer depends on this being correct.

Though perf does not prevent that a related mapping is split via mmap(2),
munmap(2) or mremap(2). A split of a VMA results in perf_mmap_open() calls,
which take reference counts, but then the subsequent perf_mmap_close()
calls are not longer fulfilling the offset and size checks. This leads to
reference count leaks.

As perf already has the requirement for subsequent mappings to match the
initial mapping, the obvious consequence is that VMA splits, caused by
resizing of a mapping or partial unmapping, have to be prevented.

Implement the vm_operations_struct::may_split() callback and return
unconditionally -EINVAL.

That ensures that the mapping offsets and sizes cannot be changed after the
fact. Remapping to a different fixed address with the same size is still
possible as it takes the references for the new mapping and drops those of
the old mapping.

## AP-CVE-2025-38565 : CVE-2025-38565 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/core: Exit early on perf_mmap() fail

When perf_mmap() fails to allocate a buffer, it still invokes the
event_mapped() callback of the related event. On X86 this might increase
the perf_rdpmc_allowed reference counter. But nothing undoes this as
perf_mmap_close() is never called in this case, which causes another
reference count leak.

Return early on failure to prevent that.

Multiple race conditions existed between the PCIe hotplug driver and the
EEH driver, leading to a variety of kernel oopses of the same general
nature:

<pcie device unplug>
<eeh driver trigger>
<hotplug removal trigger>
<pcie tree reconfiguration>
<eeh recovery next step>
<oops in EEH driver bus iteration loop>

A second class of oops is also seen when the underlying bus disappears
during device recovery.

Refactor the EEH module to be PCI rescan and remove safe.  Also clean
up a few minor formatting / readability issues.

## AP-CVE-2025-38579 : CVE-2025-38579 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix KMSAN uninit-value in extent_info usage

KMSAN reported a use of uninitialized value in `__is_extent_mergeable()`
 and `__is_back_mergeable()` via the read extent tree path.

The root cause is that `get_read_extent_info()` only initializes three
fields (`fofs`, `blk`, `len`) of `struct extent_info`, leaving the
remaining fields uninitialized. This leads to undefined behavior
when those fields are accessed later, especially during
extent merging.

Fix it by zero-initializing the `extent_info` struct before population.

fib6_info_uses_dev() seems to rely on RCU without an explicit

we need to make sure fib6_del_route() or fib6_add_rt2node()

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: prevent infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size()

While testing prior patch, I was able to trigger
an infinite loop in rt6_nlmsg_size() in the following place:

list_for_each_entry_rcu(sibling, &f6i->fib6_siblings,
			fib6_siblings) {
	rt6_nh_nlmsg_size(sibling->fib6_nh, &nexthop_len);
}

This is because fib6_del_route() and fib6_add_rt2node()
uses list_del_rcu(), which can confuse rcu readers,
because they might no longer see the head of the list.

Restart the loop if f6i->fib6_nsiblings is zero.

wifi: ath11k: clear initialized flag for deinit-ed srng lists

In a number of cases we see kernel panics on resume due
to ath11k kernel page fault, which happens under the
following circumstances:

1) First ath11k_hal_dump_srng_stats() call

 Last interrupt received for each group:

 ath11k_pci 0000:01:00.0: failed to reconfigure driver on crash recovery
 [..]

2) At this point reconfiguration fails (we have 2 resets) and
  ath11k_core_reconfigure_on_crash() calls ath11k_hal_srng_deinit()
  which destroys srng lists.  However, it does not reset per-list
  ->initialized flag.

3) Second ath11k_hal_dump_srng_stats() call sees stale ->initialized
  flag and attempts to dump srng stats:

## AP-CVE-2025-38608 : CVE-2025-38608 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, ktls: Fix data corruption when using bpf_msg_pop_data() in ktls

When sending plaintext data, we initially calculated the corresponding
ciphertext length. However, if we later reduced the plaintext data length
via socket policy, we failed to recalculate the ciphertext length.

This results in transmitting buffers containing uninitialized data during
ciphertext transmission.

This causes uninitialized bytes to be appended after a complete
"Application Data" packet, leading to errors on the receiving end when
parsing TLS record.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powercap: dtpm_cpu: Fix NULL pointer dereference in get_pd_power_uw()

The get_pd_power_uw() function can crash with a NULL pointer dereference
when em_cpu_get() returns NULL. This occurs when a CPU becomes impossible
during runtime, causing get_cpu_device() to return NULL, which propagates
through em_cpu_get() and leads to a crash when em_span_cpus() dereferences
the NULL pointer.

Add a NULL check after em_cpu_get() and return 0 if unavailable,
matching the existing fallback behavior in __dtpm_cpu_setup().

## AP-CVE-2025-38614 : CVE-2025-38614 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eventpoll: Fix semi-unbounded recursion

Ensure that epoll instances can never form a graph deeper than
EP_MAX_NESTS+1 links.

Currently, ep_loop_check_proc() ensures that the graph is loop-free and
does some recursion depth checks, but those recursion depth checks don't
limit the depth of the resulting tree for two reasons:

 - They don't look upwards in the tree.
 - If there are multiple downwards paths of different lengths, only one of
   the paths is actually considered for the depth check since commit
   28d82dc1c4ed ("epoll: limit paths").

Essentially, the current recursion depth check in ep_loop_check_proc() just
serves to prevent it from recursing too deeply while checking for loops.

A more thorough check is done in reverse_path_check() after the new graph
edge has already been created; this checks, among other things, that no
paths going upwards from any non-epoll file with a length of more than 5
edges exist. However, this check does not apply to non-epoll files.

As a result, it is possible to recurse to a depth of at least roughly 500,
tested on v6.15. (I am unsure if deeper recursion is possible; and this may
have changed with commit 8c44dac8add7 ("eventpoll: Fix priority inversion
problem").)

To fix it:

1. In ep_loop_check_proc(), note the subtree depth of each visited node,
and use subtree depths for the total depth calculation even when a subtree
has already been visited.
2. Add ep_get_upwards_depth_proc() for similarly determining the maximum
depth of an upwards walk.
3. In ep_loop_check(), use these values to limit the total path length
between epoll nodes to EP_MAX_NESTS edges.

## AP-CVE-2025-38617 : CVE-2025-38617 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/packet: fix a race in packet_set_ring() and packet_notifier()

When packet_set_ring() releases po->bind_lock, another thread can
run packet_notifier() and process an NETDEV_UP event.

This race and the fix are both similar to that of commit 15fe076edea7
("net/packet: fix a race in packet_bind() and packet_notifier()").

There too the packet_notifier NETDEV_UP event managed to run while a
po->bind_lock critical section had to be temporarily released. And
the fix was similarly to temporarily set po->num to zero to keep
the socket unhooked until the lock is retaken.

The po->bind_lock in packet_set_ring and packet_notifier precede the
introduction of git history.

## AP-CVE-2025-38618 : CVE-2025-38618 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Do not allow binding to VMADDR_PORT_ANY

It is possible for a vsock to autobind to VMADDR_PORT_ANY. This can
cause a use-after-free when a connection is made to the bound socket.
The socket returned by accept() also has port VMADDR_PORT_ANY but is not
on the list of unbound sockets. Binding it will result in an extra
refcount decrement similar to the one fixed in fcdd2242c023 (vsock: Keep
the binding until socket destruction).

Modify the check in __vsock_bind_connectible() to also prevent binding
to VMADDR_PORT_ANY.

To trigger gso segment in udp_queue_rcv_skb(), we should also set option
UDP_ENCAP_ESPINUDP to enable udp_sk(sk)->encap_rcv. When the encap_rcv
hook return 1 in udp_queue_rcv_one_skb(), udp_csum_pull_header() will try
to pull udphdr, but the skb size has been segmented to gso size, which
leads to this crash.

introduces segmentation in UDP receive path only for GRO, which was never
intended to be used for UFO, so drop UFO packets in udp_rcv_segment().

## AP-CVE-2025-38623 : CVE-2025-38623 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: pnv_php: Fix surprise plug detection and recovery

The existing PowerNV hotplug code did not handle surprise plug events
correctly, leading to a complete failure of the hotplug system after device
removal and a required reboot to detect new devices.

This comes down to two issues:

 1) When a device is surprise removed, often the bridge upstream
    port will cause a PE freeze on the PHB.  If this freeze is not
    cleared, the MSI interrupts from the bridge hotplug notification
    logic will not be received by the kernel, stalling all plug events
    on all slots associated with the PE.

 2) When a device is removed from a slot, regardless of surprise or
    programmatic removal, the associated PHB/PE ls left frozen.
    If this freeze is not cleared via a fundamental reset, skiboot
    is unable to clear the freeze and cannot retrain / rescan the
    slot.  This also requires a reboot to clear the freeze and redetect
    the device in the slot.

Issue the appropriate unfreeze and rescan commands on hotplug events,
and don't oops on hotplug if pci_bus_to_OF_node() returns NULL.

## AP-CVE-2025-38624 : CVE-2025-38624 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: pnv_php: Clean up allocated IRQs on unplug

When the root of a nested PCIe bridge configuration is unplugged, the
pnv_php driver leaked the allocated IRQ resources for the child bridges'
hotplug event notifications, resulting in a panic.

Fix this by walking all child buses and deallocating all its IRQ resources
before calling pci_hp_remove_devices().

Also modify the lifetime of the workqueue at struct pnv_php_slot::wq so
that it is only destroyed in pnv_php_free_slot(), instead of
pnv_php_disable_irq(). This is required since pnv_php_disable_irq() will
now be called by workers triggered by hot unplug interrupts, so the
workqueue needs to stay allocated.

The abridged kernel panic that occurs without this patch is as follows:

To avoid deadlock, Commit 31651c607151 ("hfsplus: avoid deadlock
on file truncation") unlock extree before hfsplus_free_extents(),
and add check wheather extree is locked in hfsplus_free_extents().

However, when operations such as hfsplus_file_release,
hfsplus_setattr, hfsplus_unlink, and hfsplus_get_block are executed
concurrently in different files, it is very likely to trigger the
WARN_ON, which will lead syzbot and xfstest to consider it as an
abnormality.

The comment above this warning also describes one of the easy
triggering situations, which can easily trigger and cause
xfstest&syzbot to report errors.

we need to remove the warning.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: netlink: can_changelink(): fix NULL pointer deref of struct can_priv::do_set_mode

Andrei Lalaev reported a NULL pointer deref when a CAN device is
restarted from Bus Off and the driver does not implement the struct
can_priv::do_set_mode callback.

There are 2 code path that call struct can_priv::do_set_mode:
- directly by a manual restart from the user space, via
  can_changelink()
- delayed automatic restart after bus off (deactivated by default)

To prevent the NULL pointer deference, refuse a manual restart or
configure the automatic restart delay in can_changelink() and report
the error via extack to user space.

As an additional safety measure let can_restart() return an error if
can_priv::do_set_mode is not set instead of dereferencing it
unchecked.

## AP-CVE-2025-38668 : CVE-2025-38668 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: core: fix NULL dereference on unbind due to stale coupling data

Failing to reset coupling_desc.n_coupled after freeing coupled_rdevs can
lead to NULL pointer dereference when regulators are accessed post-unbind.

This can happen during runtime PM or other regulator operations that rely
on coupling metadata.

For example, on ridesx4, unbinding the 'reg-dummy' platform device triggers
a panic in regulator_lock_recursive() due to stale coupling state.

Ensure n_coupled is set to 0 to prevent access to invalid pointers.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: qup: jump out of the loop in case of timeout

Original logic only sets the return value but doesn't jump out of the
loop if the bus is kept active by a client. This is not expected. A
malicious or buggy i2c client can hang the kernel in this case and
should be avoided. This is observed during a long time test with a
PCA953x GPIO extender.

Fix it by changing the logic to not only sets the return value, but also
jumps out of the loop and return to the caller with -ETIMEDOUT.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: separate no-async decryption request handling from async

If we're not doing async, the handling is much simpler. There's no
reference counting, we just need to wait for the completion to wake us
up and return its result.

We should preferably also use a separate crypto_wait. I'm not seeing a
UAF as I did in the past, I think aec7961916f3 ("tls: fix race between
async notify and socket close") took care of it.

This will make the next fix easier.

as inode node, so that get_dnode_addr() returns 360, then it tries to
access page address from 360 + 934 * 4 = 4096 w/ 4 bytes.

To fix this issue, let's add sanity check for node id of all direct nodes
during f2fs_get_dnode_of_data().

## AP-CVE-2025-9784 : CVE-2025-9784 Exploitation
Description: A flaw was found in Undertow where malformed client requests can trigger server-side stream resets without triggering abuse counters. This issue, referred to as the "MadeYouReset" attack, allows malicious clients to induce excessive server workload by repeatedly causing server-side stream aborts. While not a protocol bug, this highlights a common implementation weakness that can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS).

## AP-CVE-2025-38679 : CVE-2025-38679 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: venus: Fix OOB read due to missing payload bound check

Currently, The event_seq_changed() handler processes a variable number
of properties sent by the firmware. The number of properties is indicated
by the firmware and used to iterate over the payload. However, the
payload size is not being validated against the actual message length.

This can lead to out-of-bounds memory access if the firmware provides a
property count that exceeds the data available in the payload. Such a
condition can result in kernel crashes or potential information leaks if
memory beyond the buffer is accessed.

Fix this by properly validating the remaining size of the payload before
each property access and updating bounds accordingly as properties are
parsed.

This ensures that property parsing is safely bounded within the received
message buffer and protects against malformed or malicious firmware
behavior.

The buffer length check before calling uvc_parse_format() only ensured
that the buffer has at least 3 bytes (buflen > 2), buf the function
accesses buffer[3], requiring at least 4 bytes.

This can lead to an out-of-bounds read if the buffer has exactly 3 bytes.

Fix it by checking that the buffer has at least 4 bytes in
uvc_parse_format().

## AP-CVE-2025-38681 : CVE-2025-38681 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/ptdump: take the memory hotplug lock inside ptdump_walk_pgd()

Memory hot remove unmaps and tears down various kernel page table regions
as required.  The ptdump code can race with concurrent modifications of
the kernel page tables.  When leaf entries are modified concurrently, the
dump code may log stale or inconsistent information for a VA range, but
this is otherwise not harmful.

But when intermediate levels of kernel page table are freed, the dump code
will continue to use memory that has been freed and potentially
reallocated for another purpose.  In such cases, the ptdump code may
dereference bogus addresses, leading to a number of potential problems.

To avoid the above mentioned race condition, platforms such as arm64,
riscv and s390 take memory hotplug lock, while dumping kernel page table
via the sysfs interface /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables.

Similar race condition exists while checking for pages that might have
been marked W+X via /sys/kernel/debug/kernel_page_tables/check_wx_pages
which in turn calls ptdump_check_wx().  Instead of solving this race
condition again, let's just move the memory hotplug lock inside generic
ptdump_check_wx() which will benefit both the scenarios.

Drop get_online_mems() and put_online_mems() combination from all existing
platform ptdump code paths.

## AP-CVE-2025-38684 : CVE-2025-38684 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: ets: use old 'nbands' while purging unused classes

Shuang reported sch_ets test-case [1] crashing in ets_class_qlen_notify()
after recent changes from Lion [2]. The problem is: in ets_qdisc_change()
we purge unused DWRR queues; the value of 'q->nbands' is the new one, and
the cleanup should be done with the old one. The problem is here since my
first attempts to fix ets_qdisc_change(), but it surfaced again after the
recent qdisc len accounting fixes. Fix it purging idle DWRR queues before
assigning a new value of 'q->nbands', so that all purge operations find a
consistent configuration:

 - old 'q->nbands' because it's needed by ets_class_find()
 - old 'q->nstrict' because it's needed by ets_class_is_strict()

## AP-CVE-2025-38685 : CVE-2025-38685 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: Fix vmalloc out-of-bounds write in fast_imageblit

This issue triggers when a userspace program does an ioctl
FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP by passing console number and frame buffer number.
Ideally this maps console to frame buffer and updates the screen if
console is visible.

As part of mapping it has to do resize of console according to frame
buffer info. if this resize fails and returns from vc_do_resize() and
continues further. At this point console and new frame buffer are mapped
and sets display vars. Despite failure still it continue to proceed
updating the screen at later stages where vc_data is related to previous
frame buffer and frame buffer info and display vars are mapped to new
frame buffer and eventully leading to out-of-bounds write in
fast_imageblit(). This bheviour is excepted only when fg_console is
equal to requested console which is a visible console and updates screen
with invalid struct references in fbcon_putcs().

## AP-CVE-2025-38687 : CVE-2025-38687 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: fix race between polling and detaching

syzbot reports a use-after-free in comedi in the below link, which is
due to comedi gladly removing the allocated async area even though poll
requests are still active on the wait_queue_head inside of it. This can
cause a use-after-free when the poll entries are later triggered or
removed, as the memory for the wait_queue_head has been freed.  We need
to check there are no tasks queued on any of the subdevices' wait queues
before allowing the device to be detached by the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG`
ioctl.

Tasks will read-lock `dev->attach_lock` before adding themselves to the
subdevice wait queue, so fix the problem in the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG` ioctl
handler by write-locking `dev->attach_lock` before checking that all of
the subdevices are safe to be deleted.  This includes testing for any
sleepers on the subdevices' wait queues.  It remains locked until the
device has been detached.  This requires the `comedi_device_detach()`
function to be refactored slightly, moving the bulk of it into new
function `comedi_device_detach_locked()`.

Note that the refactor of `comedi_device_detach()` results in
`comedi_device_cancel_all()` now being called while `dev->attach_lock`
is write-locked, which wasn't the case previously, but that does not
matter.

Thanks to Jens Axboe for diagnosing the problem and co-developing this
patch.

retry loop. But ext_tree_free_commitdata() is called on every iteration
and tries to put pages in the array, thus dereferencing uninitialized
pointers.

An additional problem is that there is no limit on the maximum possible
buffer_size. When there are too many extents, the client may create a
layoutcommit that is larger than the maximum possible RPC size accepted
by the server.

During testing, we observed two typical scenarios. First, one memory page
for extents is enough when we work with small files, append data to the
end of the file, or preallocate extents before writing. But when we fill
a new large file without preallocating, the number of extents can be huge,
and counting the number of written extents in ext_tree_encode_commit()
does not help much. Since this number increases even more between
unlocking and locking of ext_tree, the reallocated buffer may not be
large enough again and again.

## AP-CVE-2025-38693 : CVE-2025-38693 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvb-frontends: w7090p: fix null-ptr-deref in w7090p_tuner_write_serpar and w7090p_tuner_read_serpar

In w7090p_tuner_write_serpar, msg is controlled by user. When msg[0].buf is null and msg[0].len is zero, former checks on msg[0].buf would be passed. If accessing msg[0].buf[2] without sanity check, null pointer deref would happen. We add
check on msg[0].len to prevent crash.

## AP-CVE-2025-38695 : CVE-2025-38695 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Check for hdwq null ptr when cleaning up lpfc_vport structure

If a call to lpfc_sli4_read_rev() from lpfc_sli4_hba_setup() fails, the
resultant cleanup routine lpfc_sli4_vport_delete_fcp_xri_aborted() may
occur before sli4_hba.hdwqs are allocated.  This may result in a null
pointer dereference when attempting to take the abts_io_buf_list_lock for
the first hardware queue.  Fix by adding a null ptr check on
phba->sli4_hba.hdwq and early return because this situation means there
must have been an error during port initialization.

## AP-CVE-2025-38696 : CVE-2025-38696 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

MIPS: Don't crash in stack_top() for tasks without ABI or vDSO

Not all tasks have an ABI associated or vDSO mapped,
for example kthreads never do.
If such a task ever ends up calling stack_top(), it will derefence the
NULL ABI pointer and crash.

This can for example happen when using kunit:

    mips_stack_top+0x28/0xc0
    arch_pick_mmap_layout+0x190/0x220
    kunit_vm_mmap_init+0xf8/0x138

    kthread+0x118/0x240
    ret_from_kernel_thread+0x14/0x1c

Only dereference the ABI point if it is set.

The GIC page is also included as it is specific to the vDSO.
Also move the randomization adjustment into the same conditional.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: bfa: Double-free fix

When the bfad_im_probe() function fails during initialization, the memory
pointed to by bfad->im is freed without setting bfad->im to NULL.

Subsequently, during driver uninstallation, when the state machine enters
the bfad_sm_stopping state and calls the bfad_im_probe_undo() function,
it attempts to free the memory pointed to by bfad->im again, thereby
triggering a double-free vulnerability.

Set bfad->im to NULL if probing fails.

## AP-CVE-2025-38700 : CVE-2025-38700 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: libiscsi: Initialize iscsi_conn->dd_data only if memory is allocated

In case of an ib_fast_reg_mr allocation failure during iSER setup, the
machine hits a panic because iscsi_conn->dd_data is initialized
unconditionally, even when no memory is allocated (dd_size == 0).  This
leads invalid pointer dereference during connection teardown.

Fix by setting iscsi_conn->dd_data only if memory is actually allocated.

## AP-CVE-2025-38701 : CVE-2025-38701 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: do not BUG when INLINE_DATA_FL lacks system.data xattr

A syzbot fuzzed image triggered a BUG_ON in ext4_update_inline_data()
when an inode had the INLINE_DATA_FL flag set but was missing the
system.data extended attribute.

Since this can happen due to a maiciouly fuzzed file system, we
shouldn't BUG, but rather, report it as a corrupted file system.

Add similar replacements of BUG_ON with EXT4_ERROR_INODE() ii
ext4_create_inline_data() and ext4_inline_data_truncate().

## AP-CVE-2025-38711 : CVE-2025-38711 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb/server: avoid deadlock when linking with ReplaceIfExists

If smb2_create_link() is called with ReplaceIfExists set and the name
does exist then a deadlock will happen.

ksmbd_vfs_kern_path_locked() will return with success and the parent
directory will be locked.  ksmbd_vfs_remove_file() will then remove the
file.  ksmbd_vfs_link() will then be called while the parent is still
locked.  It will try to lock the same parent and will deadlock.

This patch moves the ksmbd_vfs_kern_path_unlock() call to *before*
ksmbd_vfs_link() and then simplifies the code, removing the file_present
flag variable.

## AP-CVE-2025-38721 : CVE-2025-38721 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ctnetlink: fix refcount leak on table dump

There is a reference count leak in ctnetlink_dump_table():
      if (res < 0) {
                nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general); // HERE
                cb->args[1] = (unsigned long)ct;
                ...

While its very unlikely, its possible that ct == last.
If this happens, then the refcount of ct was already incremented.
This 2nd increment is never undone.

This prevents the conntrack object from being released, which in turn
keeps prevents cnet->count from dropping back to 0.

This will then block the netns dismantle (or conntrack rmmod) as
nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list() will wait forever.

This can be reproduced by running conntrack_resize.sh selftest in a loop.
It takes ~20 minutes for me on a preemptible kernel on average before
I see a runaway kworker spinning in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list.

One fix would to change this to:
        if (res < 0) {
		if (ct != last)
	                nf_conntrack_get(&ct->ct_general);

But this reference counting isn't needed in the first place.
We can just store a cookie value instead.

A followup patch will do the same for ctnetlink_exp_dump_table,
it looks to me as if this has the same problem and like
ctnetlink_dump_table, we only need a 'skip hint', not the actual
object so we can apply the same cookie strategy there as well.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: BPF: Fix jump offset calculation in tailcall

The extra pass of bpf_int_jit_compile() skips JIT context initialization
which essentially skips offset calculation leaving out_offset = -1, so
the jmp_offset in emit_bpf_tail_call is calculated by

"#define jmp_offset (out_offset - (cur_offset))"

is a negative number, which is wrong. The final generated assembly are
as follow.

## AP-CVE-2025-38724 : CVE-2025-38724 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: handle get_client_locked() failure in nfsd4_setclientid_confirm()

Lei Lu recently reported that nfsd4_setclientid_confirm() did not check
the return value from get_client_locked(). a SETCLIENTID_CONFIRM could
race with a confirmed client expiring and fail to get a reference. That
could later lead to a UAF.

Fix this by getting a reference early in the case where there is an
extant confirmed client. If that fails then treat it as if there were no
confirmed client found at all.

In the case where the unconfirmed client is expiring, just fail and
return the result from get_client_locked().

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: asix_devices: add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus

Without setting phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus, current driver may create
at most 32 mdio phy devices with phy address range from 0x00 ~ 0x1f.
DLink DUB-E100 H/W Ver B1 is such a device. However, only one main phy
device will bind to net phy driver. This is creating issue during system
suspend/resume since phy_polling_mode() in phy_state_machine() will
directly deference member of phydev->drv for non-main phy devices. Then
NULL pointer dereference issue will occur. Due to only external phy or
internal phy is necessary, add phy_mask for ax88772 mdio bus to workarnoud
the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-38727 : CVE-2025-38727 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netlink: avoid infinite retry looping in netlink_unicast()

netlink_attachskb() checks for the socket's read memory allocation
constraints. Firstly, it has:

  rmem < READ_ONCE(sk->sk_rcvbuf)

to check if the just increased rmem value fits into the socket's receive
buffer. If not, it proceeds and tries to wait for the memory under:

  rmem + skb->truesize > READ_ONCE(sk->sk_rcvbuf)

The checks don't cover the case when skb->truesize + sk->sk_rmem_alloc is
equal to sk->sk_rcvbuf. Thus the function neither successfully accepts
these conditions, nor manages to reschedule the task - and is called in
retry loop for indefinite time which is caught as:

## AP-CVE-2025-38735 : CVE-2025-38735 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gve: prevent ethtool ops after shutdown

A crash can occur if an ethtool operation is invoked
after shutdown() is called.

shutdown() is invoked during system shutdown to stop DMA operations
without performing expensive deallocations. It is discouraged to
unregister the netdev in this path, so the device may still be visible
to userspace and kernel helpers.

In gve, shutdown() tears down most internal data structures. If an
ethtool operation is dispatched after shutdown(), it will dereference
freed or NULL pointers, leading to a kernel panic. While graceful
shutdown normally quiesces userspace before invoking the reboot
syscall, forced shutdowns (as observed on GCP VMs) can still trigger
this path.

Fix by calling netif_device_detach() in shutdown().
This marks the device as detached so the ethtool ioctl handler
will skip dispatching operations to the driver.

## AP-CVE-2025-39673 : CVE-2025-39673 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ppp: fix race conditions in ppp_fill_forward_path

ppp_fill_forward_path() has two race conditions:

1. The ppp->channels list can change between list_empty() and
   list_first_entry(), as ppp_lock() is not held. If the only channel
   is deleted in ppp_disconnect_channel(), list_first_entry() may
   access an empty head or a freed entry, and trigger a panic.

2. pch->chan can be NULL. When ppp_unregister_channel() is called,
   pch->chan is set to NULL before pch is removed from ppp->channels.

Fix these by using a lockless RCU approach:
- Use list_first_or_null_rcu() to safely test and access the first list
  entry.
- Convert list modifications on ppp->channels to their RCU variants and
  add synchronize_net() after removal.
- Check for a NULL pch->chan before dereferencing it.

## AP-CVE-2025-39675 : CVE-2025-39675 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add null pointer check in mod_hdcp_hdcp1_create_session()

The function mod_hdcp_hdcp1_create_session() calls the function
get_first_active_display(), but does not check its return value.
The return value is a null pointer if the display list is empty.
This will lead to a null pointer dereference.

Add a null pointer check for get_first_active_display() and return
MOD_HDCP_STATUS_DISPLAY_NOT_FOUND if the function return null.

This is similar to the commit c3e9826a2202
("drm/amd/display: Add null pointer check for get_first_active_display()").

The reason is that trace_get_user will fail when processing a string
longer than FTRACE_BUFF_MAX, but not set the end of parser->buffer to 0.
Then an OOB access will be triggered in ftrace_regex_release->
ftrace_process_regex->strsep->strpbrk. We can solve this problem by
limiting access to parser->buffer when trace_get_user failed.

## AP-CVE-2025-39684 : CVE-2025-39684 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fix use of uninitialized memory in do_insn_ioctl() and do_insnlist_ioctl()

syzbot reports a KMSAN kernel-infoleak in `do_insn_ioctl()`.  A kernel
buffer is allocated to hold `insn->n` samples (each of which is an
`unsigned int`).  For some instruction types, `insn->n` samples are
copied back to user-space, unless an error code is being returned.  The
problem is that not all the instruction handlers that need to return
data to userspace fill in the whole `insn->n` samples, so that there is
an information leak.  There is a similar syzbot report for
`do_insnlist_ioctl()`, although it does not have a reproducer for it at
the time of writing.

One culprit is `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` which is used as the handler for
`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that do not have
a specific handler for that instruction, but do have an `INSN_BITS`
handler.  For `INSN_READ` it only fills in at most 1 sample, so if
`insn->n` is greater than 1, the remaining `insn->n - 1` samples copied
to userspace will be uninitialized kernel data.

Another culprit is `vm80xx_ai_insn_read()` in the "vm80xx" driver.  It
never returns an error, even if it fails to fill the buffer.

Fix it in `do_insn_ioctl()` and `do_insnlist_ioctl()` by making sure
that uninitialized parts of the allocated buffer are zeroed before
handling each instruction.

Thanks to Arnaud Lecomte for their fix to `do_insn_ioctl()`.  That fix
replaced the call to `kmalloc_array()` with `kcalloc()`, but it is not
always necessary to clear the whole buffer.

## AP-CVE-2025-39685 : CVE-2025-39685 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: pcl726: Prevent invalid irq number

The reproducer passed in an irq number(0x80008000) that was too large,
which triggered the oob.

Added an interrupt number check to prevent users from passing in an irq
number that was too large.

If `it->options[1]` is 31, then `1 << it->options[1]` is still invalid
because it shifts a 1-bit into the sign bit (which is UB in C).
Possible solutions include reducing the upper bound on the
`it->options[1]` value to 30 or lower, or using `1U << it->options[1]`.

The old code would just not attempt to request the IRQ if the
`options[1]` value were invalid.  And it would still configure the
device without interrupts even if the call to `request_irq` returned an
error.  So it would be better to combine this test with the test below.

## AP-CVE-2025-39686 : CVE-2025-39686 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Make insn_rw_emulate_bits() do insn->n samples

The `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` function is used as a default handler for
`INSN_READ` instructions for subdevices that have a handler for
`INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_READ`.  Similarly, it is used as a default
handler for `INSN_WRITE` instructions for subdevices that have a handler
for `INSN_BITS` but not for `INSN_WRITE`. It works by emulating the
`INSN_READ` or `INSN_WRITE` instruction handling with a constructed
`INSN_BITS` instruction.  However, `INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE`
instructions are supposed to be able read or write multiple samples,
indicated by the `insn->n` value, but `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` currently
only handles a single sample.  For `INSN_READ`, the comedi core will
copy `insn->n` samples back to user-space.  (That triggered KASAN
kernel-infoleak errors when `insn->n` was greater than 1, but that is
being fixed more generally elsewhere in the comedi core.)

Make `insn_rw_emulate_bits()` either handle `insn->n` samples, or return
an error, to conform to the general expectation for `INSN_READ` and
`INSN_WRITE` handlers.

## AP-CVE-2025-39689 : CVE-2025-39689 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Also allocate and copy hash for reading of filter files

Currently the reader of set_ftrace_filter and set_ftrace_notrace just adds
the pointer to the global tracer hash to its iterator. Unlike the writer
that allocates a copy of the hash, the reader keeps the pointer to the
filter hashes. This is problematic because this pointer is static across
function calls that release the locks that can update the global tracer
hashes. This can cause UAF and similar bugs.

Allocate and copy the hash for reading the filter files like it is done
for the writers. This not only fixes UAF bugs, but also makes the code a
bit simpler as it doesn't have to differentiate when to free the
iterator's hash between writers and readers.

					   unlock_buffer

            wait_on_buffer(bh);--> return will return to caller

					  put_bh
					    --> trigger stack-out-of-bounds
In the mpage_read_folio() function, the stack variable 'map_bh' is
passed to ntfs_get_block_vbo(). Once unlock_buffer() unlocks and
wait_on_buffer() returns to continue processing, the stack variable
is likely to be reclaimed. Consequently, during the end_buffer_read_sync()
process, calling put_bh() may result in stack overrun.

If the bh is not allocated on the stack, it belongs to a folio.  Freeing
a buffer head which belongs to a folio is done by drop_buffers() which
will fail to free buffers which are still locked.  So it is safe to call
put_bh() before __end_buffer_read_notouch().

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/sclp: Fix SCCB present check

Tracing code called by the SCLP interrupt handler contains early exits
if the SCCB address associated with an interrupt is NULL. This check is
performed after physical to virtual address translation.

If the kernel identity mapping does not start at address zero, the
resulting virtual address is never zero, so that the NULL checks won't
work. Subsequently this may result in incorrect accesses to the first
page of the identity mapping.

Fix this by introducing a function that handles the NULL case before
address translation.

## AP-CVE-2025-39697 : CVE-2025-39697 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Fix a race when updating an existing write

After nfs_lock_and_join_requests() tests for whether the request is
still attached to the mapping, nothing prevents a call to
nfs_inode_remove_request() from succeeding until we actually lock the
page group.
The reason is that whoever called nfs_inode_remove_request() doesn't
necessarily have a lock on the page group head.

So in order to avoid races, let's take the page group lock earlier in
nfs_lock_and_join_requests(), and hold it across the removal of the
request in nfs_inode_remove_request().

This issue was found by syzkaller.

The panic happens in br_dev_queue_push_xmit() once it receives a
corrupted skb with ETH header already pushed in linear data. When it
attempts the skb_push() call, there's not enough headroom and
skb_push() panics.

The corrupted skb is put on the queue by HSR layer, which makes a
sequence of unintended transformations when it receives a specific
corrupted HSR frame (with incomplete TAG).

Fix it by dropping and consuming frames that are not long enough to
contain both ethernet and hsr headers.

Alternative fix would be to check for enough headroom before skb_push()
in br_dev_queue_push_xmit().

In the reproducer, this is injected via AF_PACKET, but I don't easily
see why it couldn't be sent over the wire from adjacent network.

## AP-CVE-2025-39706 : CVE-2025-39706 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Destroy KFD debugfs after destroy KFD wq

Since KFD proc content was moved to kernel debugfs, we can't destroy KFD
debugfs before kfd_process_destroy_wq. Move kfd_process_destroy_wq prior
to kfd_debugfs_fini to fix a kernel NULL pointer problem. It happens
when /sys/kernel/debug/kfd was already destroyed in kfd_debugfs_fini but
kfd_process_destroy_wq calls kfd_debugfs_remove_process. This line
    debugfs_remove_recursive(entry->proc_dentry);
tries to remove /sys/kernel/debug/kfd/proc/<pid> while
/sys/kernel/debug/kfd is already gone. It hangs the kernel by kernel
NULL pointer.

## AP-CVE-2025-39713 : CVE-2025-39713 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: rainshadow-cec: fix TOCTOU race condition in rain_interrupt()

In the interrupt handler rain_interrupt(), the buffer full check on
rain->buf_len is performed before acquiring rain->buf_lock. This
creates a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition, as
rain->buf_len is concurrently accessed and modified in the work
handler rain_irq_work_handler() under the same lock.

Multiple interrupt invocations can race, with each reading buf_len
before it becomes full and then proceeding. This can lead to both
interrupts attempting to write to the buffer, incrementing buf_len
beyond its capacity (DATA_SIZE) and causing a buffer overflow.

Fix this bug by moving the spin_lock() to before the buffer full
check. This ensures that the check and the subsequent buffer modification
are performed atomically, preventing the race condition. An corresponding
spin_unlock() is added to the overflow path to correctly release the
lock.

This possible bug was found by an experimental static analysis tool
developed by our team.

## AP-CVE-2025-39714 : CVE-2025-39714 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: usbtv: Lock resolution while streaming

When an program is streaming (ffplay) and another program (qv4l2)
changes the TV standard from NTSC to PAL, the kernel crashes due to trying
to copy to unmapped memory.

Changing from NTSC to PAL increases the resolution in the usbtv struct,
but the video plane buffer isn't adjusted, so it overflows.

## AP-CVE-2025-39715 : CVE-2025-39715 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: Revise gateway LWS calls to probe user read access

We use load and stbys,e instructions to trigger memory reference
interruptions without writing to memory. Because of the way read
access support is implemented, read access interruptions are only
triggered at privilege levels 2 and 3. The kernel and gateway
page execute at privilege level 0, so this code never triggers
a read access interruption. Thus, it is currently possible for
user code to execute a LWS compare and swap operation at an
address that is read protected at privilege level 3 (PRIV_USER).

Fix this by probing read access rights at privilege level 3 and
branching to lws_fault if access isn't allowed.

## AP-CVE-2025-39716 : CVE-2025-39716 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: Revise __get_user() to probe user read access

Because of the way read access support is implemented, read access
interruptions are only triggered at privilege levels 2 and 3. The
kernel executes at privilege level 0, so __get_user() never triggers
a read access interruption (code 26). Thus, it is currently possible
for user code to access a read protected address via a system call.

Fix this by probing read access rights at privilege level 3 (PRIV_USER)
and setting __gu_err to -EFAULT (-14) if access isn't allowed.

Note the cmpiclr instruction does a 32-bit compare because COND macro
doesn't work inside asm.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: Validate length in packet header before skb_put()

When receiving a vsock packet in the guest, only the virtqueue buffer
size is validated prior to virtio_vsock_skb_rx_put(). Unfortunately,
virtio_vsock_skb_rx_put() uses the length from the packet header as the
length argument to skb_put(), potentially resulting in SKB overflow if
the host has gone wonky.

Validate the length as advertised by the packet header before calling
virtio_vsock_skb_rx_put().

## AP-CVE-2025-39719 : CVE-2025-39719 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: imu: bno055: fix OOB access of hw_xlate array

Fix a potential out-of-bounds array access of the hw_xlate array in
bno055.c.

In bno055_get_regmask(), hw_xlate was iterated over the length of the
vals array instead of the length of the hw_xlate array. In the case of
bno055_gyr_scale, the vals array is larger than the hw_xlate array,
so this could result in an out-of-bounds access. In practice, this
shouldn't happen though because a match should always be found which
breaks out of the for loop before it iterates beyond the end of the
hw_xlate array.

By adding a new hw_xlate_len field to the bno055_sysfs_attr, we can be
sure we are iterating over the correct length.

## AP-CVE-2025-39724 : CVE-2025-39724 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: 8250: fix panic due to PSLVERR

When the PSLVERR_RESP_EN parameter is set to 1, the device generates
an error response if an attempt is made to read an empty RBR (Receive
Buffer Register) while the FIFO is enabled.

In serial8250_do_startup(), calling serial_port_out(port, UART_LCR,
UART_LCR_WLEN8) triggers dw8250_check_lcr(), which invokes
dw8250_force_idle() and serial8250_clear_and_reinit_fifos(). The latter
function enables the FIFO via serial_out(p, UART_FCR, p->fcr).
Execution proceeds to the serial_port_in(port, UART_RX).
This satisfies the PSLVERR trigger condition.

When another CPU (e.g., using printk()) is accessing the UART (UART
is busy), the current CPU fails the check (value & ~UART_LCR_SPAR) ==
(lcr & ~UART_LCR_SPAR) in dw8250_check_lcr(), causing it to enter
dw8250_force_idle().

Put serial_port_out(port, UART_LCR, UART_LCR_WLEN8) under the port->lock
to fix this issue.

inversion with the netconsole subsystem.  This occurs because
pr_warn_once() may trigger netpoll, which eventually leads to
__alloc_skb() and back into kmemleak code, attempting to reacquire
kmemleak_lock.

This is the path for the deadlock.

mem_pool_alloc()
  -> raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&kmemleak_lock, flags);
      -> pr_warn_once()
          -> netconsole subsystem
	     -> netpoll
	         -> __alloc_skb
		   -> __create_object
		     -> raw_spin_lock_irqsave(&kmemleak_lock, flags);

Fix this by setting a flag and issuing the pr_warn_once() after
kmemleak_lock is released.

## AP-CVE-2025-39738 : CVE-2025-39738 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: do not allow relocation of partially dropped subvolumes

[BUG]
There is an internal report that balance triggered transaction abort,

 BTRFS: Transaction aborted (error -117)
 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 6963 at ../fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c:2168 btrfs_run_delayed_refs+0xfa/0x110 [btrfs]

And btrfs check doesn't report anything wrong related to the extent
tree.

[CAUSE]
The cause is a little complex, firstly the extent tree indeed doesn't
have the backref for 594526208.

The extent tree only have the following two backrefs around that bytenr
on-disk:

        item 65 key (594509824 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13880 itemsize 33
                refs 1 gen 197740 flags TREE_BLOCK
                tree block skinny level 0
                (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE
        item 66 key (594558976 METADATA_ITEM 0) itemoff 13847 itemsize 33
                refs 1 gen 197522 flags TREE_BLOCK
                tree block skinny level 0
                (176 0x7) tree block backref root CSUM_TREE

But the such missing backref item is not an corruption on disk, as the
offending delayed ref belongs to subvolume 934, and that subvolume is
being dropped:

        item 0 key (934 ROOT_ITEM 198229) itemoff 15844 itemsize 439
                generation 198229 root_dirid 256 bytenr 10741039104 byte_limit 0 bytes_used 345571328
                last_snapshot 198229 flags 0x1000000000001(RDONLY) refs 0
                drop_progress key (206324 EXTENT_DATA 2711650304) drop_level 2
                level 2 generation_v2 198229

And that offending tree block 594526208 is inside the dropped range of
that subvolume.  That explains why there is no backref item for that
bytenr and why btrfs check is not reporting anything wrong.

But this also shows another problem, as btrfs will do all the orphan
subvolume cleanup at a read-write mount.

So half-dropped subvolume should not exist after an RW mount, and
balance itself is also exclusive to subvolume cleanup, meaning we
shouldn't hit a subvolume half-dropped during relocation.

The root cause is, there is no orphan item for this subvolume.
In fact there are 5 subvolumes from around 2021 that have the same
problem.

It looks like the original report has some older kernels running, and
caused those zombie subvolumes.

Thankfully upstream commit 8d488a8c7ba2 ("btrfs: fix subvolume/snapshot
deletion not triggered on mount") has long fixed the bug.

[ENHANCEMENT]
For repairing such old fs, btrfs-progs will be enhanced.

Considering how delayed the problem will show up (at run delayed ref
time) and at that time we have to abort transaction already, it is too
late.

Instead here we reject any half-dropped subvolume for reloc tree at the
earliest time, preventing confusion and extra time wasted on debugging
similar bugs.

## AP-CVE-2025-39749 : CVE-2025-39749 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu: Protect ->defer_qs_iw_pending from data race

On kernels built with CONFIG_IRQ_WORK=y, when rcu_read_unlock() is
invoked within an interrupts-disabled region of code [1], it will invoke
rcu_read_unlock_special(), which uses an irq-work handler to force the
system to notice when the RCU read-side critical section actually ends.
That end won't happen until interrupts are enabled at the soonest.

In some kernels, such as those booted with rcutree.use_softirq=y, the
irq-work handler is used unconditionally.

The per-CPU rcu_data structure's ->defer_qs_iw_pending field is
updated by the irq-work handler and is both read and updated by
rcu_read_unlock_special().  This resulted in the following KCSAN splat:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem is that irq-work handlers run with interrupts enabled, which
means that rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() could be interrupted,
and that interrupt handler might contain an RCU read-side critical
section, which might invoke rcu_read_unlock_special().  In the strict
KCSAN mode of operation used by RCU, this constitutes a data race on
the ->defer_qs_iw_pending field.

This commit therefore disables interrupts across the portion of the
rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_handler() that updates the ->defer_qs_iw_pending
field.  This suffices because this handler is not a fast path.

Sometimes that leads to kernel hang. Probably because secondary

## AP-CVE-2025-39756 : CVE-2025-39756 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: Prevent file descriptor table allocations exceeding INT_MAX

When sysctl_nr_open is set to a very high value (for example, 1073741816
as set by systemd), processes attempting to use file descriptors near
the limit can trigger massive memory allocation attempts that exceed
INT_MAX, resulting in a WARNING in mm/slub.c:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 44 at mm/slub.c:5027 __kvmalloc_node_noprof+0x21a/0x288

This happens because kvmalloc_array() and kvmalloc() check if the
requested size exceeds INT_MAX and emit a warning when the allocation is
not flagged with __GFP_NOWARN.

Specifically, when nr_open is set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8) and a
process calls dup2(oldfd, 1073741880), the kernel attempts to allocate:
- File descriptor array: 1073741880 * 8 bytes = 8,589,935,040 bytes
- Multiple bitmaps: ~400MB
- Total allocation size: > 8GB (exceeding INT_MAX = 2,147,483,647)

Reproducer:
1. Set /proc/sys/fs/nr_open to 1073741816:
   # echo 1073741816 > /proc/sys/fs/nr_open

2. Run a program that uses a high file descriptor:
   #include <unistd.h>
   #include <sys/resource.h>

   int main() {
       struct rlimit rlim = {1073741824, 1073741824};
       setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &rlim);
       dup2(2, 1073741880);  // Triggers the warning
       return 0;
   }

3. Observe WARNING in dmesg at mm/slub.c:5027

systemd commit a8b627a introduced automatic bumping of fs.nr_open to the
maximum possible value. The rationale was that systems with memory
control groups (memcg) no longer need separate file descriptor limits
since memory is properly accounted. However, this change overlooked
that:

1. The kernel's allocation functions still enforce INT_MAX as a maximum
   size regardless of memcg accounting
2. Programs and tests that legitimately test file descriptor limits can
   inadvertently trigger massive allocations
3. The resulting allocations (>8GB) are impractical and will always fail

systemd's algorithm starts with INT_MAX and keeps halving the value
until the kernel accepts it. On most systems, this results in nr_open
being set to 1073741816 (0x3ffffff8), which is just under 1GB of file
descriptors.

While processes rarely use file descriptors near this limit in normal
operation, certain selftests (like
tools/testing/selftests/core/unshare_test.c) and programs that test file
descriptor limits can trigger this issue.

Fix this by adding a check in alloc_fdtable() to ensure the requested
allocation size does not exceed INT_MAX. This causes the operation to
fail with -EMFILE instead of triggering a kernel warning and avoids the
impractical >8GB memory allocation request.

## AP-CVE-2025-39759 : CVE-2025-39759 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: qgroup: fix race between quota disable and quota rescan ioctl

There's a race between a task disabling quotas and another running the
rescan ioctl that can result in a use-after-free of qgroup records from
the fs_info->qgroup_tree rbtree.

This happens as follows:

1) Task A enters btrfs_ioctl_quota_rescan() -> btrfs_qgroup_rescan();

2) Task B enters btrfs_quota_disable() and calls
   btrfs_qgroup_wait_for_completion(), which does nothing because at that
   point fs_info->qgroup_rescan_running is false (it wasn't set yet by
   task A);

3) Task B calls btrfs_free_qgroup_config() which starts freeing qgroups
   from fs_info->qgroup_tree without taking the lock fs_info->qgroup_lock;

4) Task A enters qgroup_rescan_zero_tracking() which starts iterating
   the fs_info->qgroup_tree tree while holding fs_info->qgroup_lock,
   but task B is freeing qgroup records from that tree without holding
   the lock, resulting in a use-after-free.

Fix this by taking fs_info->qgroup_lock at btrfs_free_qgroup_config().
Also at btrfs_qgroup_rescan() don't start the rescan worker if quotas
were already disabled.

## AP-CVE-2025-39766 : CVE-2025-39766 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: Make cake_enqueue return NET_XMIT_CN when past buffer_limit

The following setup can trigger a WARNING in htb_activate due to
the condition: !cl->leaf.q->q.qlen

tc qdisc del dev lo root
tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: htb default 1
tc class add dev lo parent 1: classid 1:1 \
       htb rate 64bit
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle f: \
       cake memlimit 1b
ping -I lo -f -c1 -s64 -W0.001 127.0.0.1

This is because the low memlimit leads to a low buffer_limit, which
causes packet dropping. However, cake_enqueue still returns
NET_XMIT_SUCCESS, causing htb_enqueue to call htb_activate with an
empty child qdisc. We should return NET_XMIT_CN when packets are
dropped from the same tin and flow.

I do not believe return value of NET_XMIT_CN is necessary for packet
drops in the case of ack filtering, as that is meant to optimize
performance, not to signal congestion.

Description: 1. A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target`

 3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path (`path=\"/\",`).
   Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.
4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer
   boundary

The bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to
the wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the
secure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents
immediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.

The presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of
the cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding
it on an insecure host should not be okay.

## AP-CVE-2025-39871 : CVE-2025-39871 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Remove improper idxd_free

The call to idxd_free() introduces a duplicate put_device() leading to a
reference count underflow:
refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 15 PID: 4428 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xbe/0x110
...
Call Trace:

  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e

The idxd_unregister_devices() which is invoked at the very beginning of
idxd_remove(), already takes care of the necessary put_device() through the
following call path:
idxd_unregister_devices() -> device_unregister() -> put_device()

In addition, when CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE is enabled, put_device() may
trigger asynchronous cleanup via schedule_delayed_work(). If idxd_free() is
called immediately after, it can result in a use-after-free.

Remove the improper idxd_free() to avoid both the refcount underflow and
potential memory corruption during module unload.

## AP-CVE-2025-56558 : CVE-2025-56558 Exploitation
Description: The Dyson MQTT server (2022 and possibly later) allows publications and subscriptions by a client that has the correct values of AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SESSION_TOKEN, and device serial number, even if a device (such as a Pure Hot+Cool device) has been removed and is not visible in the supported MyDyson app. This could allow an unexpected actor to obtain control and set the room temperature (up to 37 Celsius) if ownership of the device is transferred without wiping the device. NOTE: the Supplier's position is that this is a potential vulnerability that dates back 4 years ago in 2022 and "we are unable to replicate that anymore." Based on the submitted report, in order to leverage this issue, an attacker needs to own a Dyson device with full privileges, sniff for the AWS credentials, and then transfer ownership of that Dyson device to the victim. Even if these steps were successfully accomplished, the attacker only acquires the ability to configure the Dyson device within its safe operating range, and does not acquire the ability to execute code on the device or obtain sensitive information.

## AP-CVE-2025-64096 : CVE-2025-64096 Exploitation
Description: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to 1.4.2, there is a missing bounds check in Crypto_Key_update() (crypto_key_mgmt.c) which allows a remote attacker to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by supplying a TLV packet with a spoofed length field. The function calculates the number of keys from an attacker-controlled field (pdu_len), which may exceed the static array size (kblk[98]), leading to an out-of-bounds write and potential memory corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.4.2.

## AP-CVE-2025-64512 : CVE-2025-64512 Exploitation
Description: Pdfminer.six is a community maintained fork of the original PDFMiner, a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Prior to version 20251107, pdfminer.six will execute arbitrary code from a malicious pickle file if provided with a malicious PDF file. The `CMapDB._load_data()` function in pdfminer.six uses `pickle.loads()` to deserialize pickle files. These pickle files are supposed to be part of the pdfminer.six distribution stored in the `cmap/` directory, but a malicious PDF can specify an alternative directory and filename as long as the filename ends in `.pickle.gz`. A malicious, zipped pickle file can then contain code which will automatically execute when the PDF is processed. Version 20251107 fixes the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-40110 : CVE-2025-40110 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix a null-ptr access in the cursor snooper

Check that the resource which is converted to a surface exists before
trying to use the cursor snooper on it.

vmw_cmd_res_check allows explicit invalid (SVGA3D_INVALID_ID) identifiers
because some svga commands accept SVGA3D_INVALID_ID to mean "no surface",
unfortunately functions that accept the actual surfaces as objects might
(and in case of the cursor snooper, do not) be able to handle null
objects. Make sure that we validate not only the identifier (via the
vmw_cmd_res_check) but also check that the actual resource exists before
trying to do something with it.

Fixes unchecked null-ptr reference in the snooping code.

## AP-CVE-2025-64500 : CVE-2025-64500 Exploitation
Description: Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony's HttpFoundation component defines an object-oriented layer for the HTTP specification. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class improperly interprets some `PATH_INFO` in a way that leads to representing some URLs with a path that doesn't start with a `/`. This can allow bypassing some access control rules that are built with this `/`-prefix assumption. Starting in versions 5.4.50, 6.4.29, and 7.3.7, the `Request` class now ensures that URL paths always start with a `/`.

This predictability allows remote attackers to brute-force valid tokens within a small time window, enabling unauthorized account confirmation, password resets, and email change approvals, potentially leading to account takeover.

Description: FileRise is a self-hosted web-based file manager with multi-file upload, editing, and batch operations. Prior to 2.2.3, a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Filerise application due to improper handling of uploaded SVG files. The application accepts user-supplied SVG uploads without sanitizing or restricting embedded script content. When a malicious SVG containing inline JavaScript or event-based payloads is uploaded, it is later rendered directly in the browser whenever viewed within the application. Because SVGs are XML-based and allow scripting, they execute in the origin context of the application, enabling full stored XSS. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.3.

## AP-CVE-2025-65955 : CVE-2025-65955 Exploitation
Description: ImageMagick is free and open-source software used for editing and manipulating digital images. Prior to 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34, there is a vulnerability in ImageMagick’s Magick++ layer that manifests when Options::fontFamily is invoked with an empty string. Clearing a font family calls RelinquishMagickMemory on _drawInfo->font, freeing the font string but leaving _drawInfo->font pointing to freed memory while _drawInfo->family is set to that (now-invalid) pointer. Any later cleanup or reuse of _drawInfo->font re-frees or dereferences dangling memory. DestroyDrawInfo and other setters (Options::font, Image::font) assume _drawInfo->font remains valid, so destruction or subsequent updates trigger crashes or heap corruption. This vulnerability is fixed in 7.1.2-9 and 6.9.13-34.

## AP-CVE-2025-40215 : CVE-2025-40215 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x

The ipcomp fallback tunnels currently get deleted (from the various
lists and hashtables) as the last user state that needed that fallback
is destroyed (not deleted). If a reference to that user state still
exists, the fallback state will remain on the hashtables/lists,
triggering the WARN in xfrm_state_fini. Because of those remaining
references, the fix in commit f75a2804da39 ("xfrm: destroy xfrm_state
synchronously on net exit path") is not complete.

We recently fixed one such situation in TCP due to defered freeing of
skbs (commit 9b6412e6979f ("tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we
currently drop dst")). This can also happen due to IP reassembly: skbs
with a secpath remain on the reassembly queue until netns
destruction. If we can't guarantee that the queues are flushed by the
time xfrm_state_fini runs, there may still be references to a (user)
xfrm_state, preventing the timely deletion of the corresponding
fallback state.

Instead of chasing each instance of skbs holding a secpath one by one,
this patch fixes the issue directly within xfrm, by deleting the
fallback state as soon as the last user state depending on it has been
deleted. Destruction will still happen when the final reference is
dropped.

A separate lockdep class for the fallback state is required since
we're going to lock x->tunnel while x is locked.

## AP-CVE-2025-40256 : CVE-2025-40256 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm: also call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel at destroy time for states that were never added

In commit b441cf3f8c4b ("xfrm: delete x->tunnel as we delete x"), I
missed the case where state creation fails between full
initialization (->init_state has been called) and being inserted on
the lists.

In this situation, ->init_state has been called, so for IPcomp
tunnels, the fallback tunnel has been created and added onto the
lists, but the user state never gets added, because we fail before
that. The user state doesn't go through __xfrm_state_delete, so we
don't call xfrm_state_delete_tunnel for those states, and we end up
leaking the FB tunnel.

There are several codepaths affected by this: the add/update paths, in
both net/key and xfrm, and the migrate code (xfrm_migrate,
xfrm_state_migrate). A "proper" rollback of the init_state work would
probably be doable in the add/update code, but for migrate it gets
more complicated as multiple states may be involved.

At some point, the new (not-inserted) state will be destroyed, so call
xfrm_state_delete_tunnel during xfrm_state_gc_destroy. Most states
will have their fallback tunnel cleaned up during __xfrm_state_delete,
which solves the issue that b441cf3f8c4b (and other patches before it)
aimed at. All states (including FB tunnels) will be removed from the
lists once xfrm_state_fini has called flush_work(&xfrm_state_gc_work).

## AP-CVE-2025-66628 : CVE-2025-66628 Exploitation
Description: ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. In versions 7.1.2-9 and prior, the TIM (PSX TIM) image parser contains a critical integer overflow vulnerability in its ReadTIMImage function (coders/tim.c). The code reads width and height (16-bit values) from the file header and calculates image_size = 2 * width * height without checking for overflow. On 32-bit systems (or where size_t is 32-bit), this calculation can overflow if width and height are large (e.g., 65535), wrapping around to a small value. This results in a small heap allocation via AcquireQuantumMemory and later operations relying on the dimensions can trigger an out of bounds read. This issue is fixed in version 7.1.2-10.

## AP-CVE-2025-14523 : CVE-2025-14523 Exploitation
Description: A flaw in libsoup’s HTTP header handling allows multiple Host: headers in a request and returns the last occurrence for server-side processing. Common front proxies often honor the first Host: header, so this mismatch can cause vhost confusion where a proxy routes a request to one backend but the backend interprets it as destined for another host. This discrepancy enables request-smuggling style attacks, cache poisoning, or bypassing host-based access controls when an attacker supplies duplicate Host headers.

## AP-CVE-2025-65835 : CVE-2025-65835 Exploitation
Description: The Cordova plugin cordova-plugin-x-socialsharing (SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin) for Android 6.0.4, registers an exported broadcast receiver nl.xservices.plugins.ShareChooserPendingIntent with an android.intent.action.SEND intent filter. The onReceive implementation accesses Intent.EXTRA_CHOSEN_COMPONENT without checking for null. If a broadcast is sent with extras present but without EXTRA_CHOSEN_COMPONENT, the code dereferences a null value and throws a NullPointerException. Because the receiver is exported and performs no permission or caller validation, any local application on the device can send crafted ACTION_SEND broadcasts to this component and repeatedly crash the host application, resulting in a local, unauthenticated application-level denial of service for any app that includes the plugin.

## AP-CVE-2025-66407 : CVE-2025-66407 Exploitation
Description: Weblate is a web based localization tool. The Create Component functionality in Weblate allows authorized users to add new translation components by specifying both a version control system and a source code repository URL to pull from. However, prior to version 5.15, the repository URL field is not validated or sanitized, allowing an attacker to supply arbitrary protocols, hostnames, and IP addresses, including localhost, internal network addresses, and local filenames. When the Mercurial version control system is selected, Weblate exposes the full server-side HTTP response for the provided URL. This effectively creates a server-side request forgery (SSRF) primitive that can probe internal services and return their contents. In addition to accessing internal HTTP endpoints, the behavior also enables local file enumeration by attempting file:// requests. While file contents may not always be returned, the application’s error messages clearly differentiate between files that exist and files that do not, revealing information about the server’s filesystem layout. In cloud environments, this behavior is particularly dangerous, as internal-only endpoints such as cloud metadata services may be accessible, potentially leading to credential disclosure and full environment compromise. This has been addressed in the Weblate 5.15 release. As a workaround, remove Mercurial from `VCS_BACKENDS`; the Git backend is not affected. The Git backend was already configured to block the file protocol and does not expose the HTTP response content in the error message.

## AP-CVE-2025-66482 : CVE-2025-66482 Exploitation
Description: Misskey is an open source, federated social media platform. Attackers who use an untrusted reverse proxy or not using a reverse proxy at all can bypass IP rate limiting by adding a forged X-Forwarded-For header. Starting with version 2025.9.1, an option (`trustProxy`) has been added in config file to prevent this from happening. However, it is initialized with an insecure default value before version 2025.12.0-alpha.2, making it still vulnerable if the configuration is not set correctly. This is patched in v2025.12.0-alpha.2 by flipping default value of `trustProxy` to `false`. Users of a trusted reverse proxy who are unsure if they manually overode this value should check their config for optimal behavior. Users are running Misskey with a trusted reverse proxy should not be affected by this vulnerability. From v2025.9.1 to v2025.11.1, workaround is available. Set `trustProxy: false` in config file.

This can be used to overwrite system binaries with ones provided from an attacker allowing full code execution. Version 0.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-68206 : CVE-2025-68206 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_ct: add seqadj extension for natted connections

Sequence adjustment may be required for FTP traffic with PASV/EPSV modes.
due to need to re-write packet payload (IP, port) on the ftp control
connection. This can require changes to the TCP length and expected
seq / ack_seq.

The easiest way to reproduce this issue is with PASV mode.
Example ruleset:
table inet ftp_nat {
        ct helper ftp_helper {
                type "ftp" protocol tcp
                l3proto inet
        }

        chain prerouting {
                type filter hook prerouting priority 0; policy accept;
                tcp dport 21 ct state new ct helper set "ftp_helper"
        }
}
table ip nat {
        chain prerouting {
                type nat hook prerouting priority -100; policy accept;
                tcp dport 21 dnat ip prefix to ip daddr map {
			192.168.100.1 : 192.168.13.2/32 }
        }

        chain postrouting {
                type nat hook postrouting priority 100 ; policy accept;
                tcp sport 21 snat ip prefix to ip saddr map {
			192.168.13.2 : 192.168.100.1/32 }
        }
}

Note that the ftp helper gets assigned *after* the dnat setup.

The inverse (nat after helper assign) is handled by an existing
check in nf_nat_setup_info() and will not show the problem.

Topoloy:

 +-------------------+     +----------------------------------+

## AP-CVE-2025-68254 : CVE-2025-68254 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in OnBeacon ESR IE parsing

The Extended Supported Rates (ESR) IE handling in OnBeacon accessed
*(p + 1 + ielen) and *(p + 2 + ielen) without verifying that these
offsets lie within the received frame buffer. A malformed beacon with
an ESR IE positioned at the end of the buffer could cause an
out-of-bounds read, potentially triggering a kernel panic.

Add a boundary check to ensure that the ESR IE body and the subsequent
bytes are within the limits of the frame before attempting to access
them.

This prevents OOB reads caused by malformed beacon frames.

## AP-CVE-2025-68255 : CVE-2025-68255 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: rtl8723bs: fix stack buffer overflow in OnAssocReq IE parsing

The Supported Rates IE length from an incoming Association Request frame
was used directly as the memcpy() length when copying into a fixed-size
16-byte stack buffer (supportRate). A malicious station can advertise an
IE length larger than 16 bytes, causing a stack buffer overflow.

Clamp ie_len to the buffer size before copying the Supported Rates IE,
and correct the bounds check when merging Extended Supported Rates to
prevent a second potential overflow.

This prevents kernel stack corruption triggered by malformed association
requests.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: rtl8723bs: fix out-of-bounds read in rtw_get_ie() parser

The Information Element (IE) parser rtw_get_ie() trusted the length
byte of each IE without validating that the IE body (len bytes after
the 2-byte header) fits inside the remaining frame buffer. A malformed
frame can advertise an IE length larger than the available data, causing
the parser to increment its pointer beyond the buffer end. This results
in out-of-bounds reads or, depending on the pattern, an infinite loop.

Fix by validating that (offset + 2 + len) does not exceed the limit
before accepting the IE or advancing to the next element.

This prevents OOB reads and ensures the parser terminates safely on
malformed frames.

## AP-CVE-2025-68257 : CVE-2025-68257 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: check device's attached status in compat ioctls

Syzbot identified an issue [1] that crashes kernel, seemingly due to
unexistent callback dev->get_valid_routes(). By all means, this should
not occur as said callback must always be set to
get_zero_valid_routes() in __comedi_device_postconfig().

As the crash seems to appear exclusively in i386 kernels, at least,
judging from [1] reports, the blame lies with compat versions
of standard IOCTL handlers. Several of them are modified and
do not use comedi_unlocked_ioctl(). While functionality of these
ioctls essentially copy their original versions, they do not
have required sanity check for device's attached status. This,
in turn, leads to a possibility of calling select IOCTLs on a
device that has not been properly setup, even via COMEDI_DEVCONFIG.

Doing so on unconfigured devices means that several crucial steps
are missed, for instance, specifying dev->get_valid_routes()
callback.

Fix this somewhat crudely by ensuring device's attached status before
performing any ioctls, improving logic consistency between modern
and compat functions.

## AP-CVE-2025-68258 : CVE-2025-68258 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: multiq3: sanitize config options in multiq3_attach()

Syzbot identified an issue [1] in multiq3_attach() that induces a
task timeout due to open() or COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl operations,
specifically, in the case of multiq3 driver.

This problem arose when syzkaller managed to craft weird configuration
options used to specify the number of channels in encoder subdevice.
If a particularly great number is passed to s->n_chan in
multiq3_attach() via it->options[2], then multiple calls to
multiq3_encoder_reset() at the end of driver-specific attach() method
will be running for minutes, thus blocking tasks and affected devices
as well.

While this issue is most likely not too dangerous for real-life
devices, it still makes sense to sanitize configuration inputs. Enable
a sensible limit on the number of encoder chips (4 chips max, each
with 2 channels) to stop this behaviour from manifesting.

## AP-CVE-2025-68259 : CVE-2025-68259 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: Don't skip unrelated instruction if INT3/INTO is replaced

When re-injecting a soft interrupt from an INT3, INT0, or (select) INTn
instruction, discard the exception and retry the instruction if the code
stream is changed (e.g. by a different vCPU) between when the CPU
executes the instruction and when KVM decodes the instruction to get the
next RIP.

As effectively predicted by commit 6ef88d6e36c2 ("KVM: SVM: Re-inject
INT3/INTO instead of retrying the instruction"), failure to verify that
the correct INTn instruction was decoded can effectively clobber guest
state due to decoding the wrong instruction and thus specifying the
wrong next RIP.

The bug most often manifests as "Oops: int3" panics on static branch
checks in Linux guests.  Enabling or disabling a static branch in Linux
uses the kernel's "text poke" code patching mechanism.  To modify code
while other CPUs may be executing that code, Linux (temporarily)
replaces the first byte of the original instruction with an int3 (opcode
0xcc), then patches in the new code stream except for the first byte,
and finally replaces the int3 with the first byte of the new code
stream.  If a CPU hits the int3, i.e. executes the code while it's being
modified, then the guest kernel must look up the RIP to determine how to
handle the #BP, e.g. by emulating the new instruction.  If the RIP is
incorrect, then this lookup fails and the guest kernel panics.

The bug reproduces almost instantly by hacking the guest kernel to
repeatedly check a static branch[1] while running a drgn script[2] on
the host to constantly swap out the memory containing the guest's TSS.

## AP-CVE-2025-68261 : CVE-2025-68261 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: add i_data_sem protection in ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock()

Fix a race between inline data destruction and block mapping.

The function ext4_destroy_inline_data_nolock() changes the inode data
layout by clearing EXT4_INODE_INLINE_DATA and setting EXT4_INODE_EXTENTS.
At the same time, another thread may execute ext4_map_blocks(), which
tests EXT4_INODE_EXTENTS to decide whether to call ext4_ext_map_blocks()
or ext4_ind_map_blocks().

Without i_data_sem protection, ext4_ind_map_blocks() may receive inode
with EXT4_INODE_EXTENTS flag and triggering assert.

## AP-CVE-2025-68263 : CVE-2025-68263 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: ipc: fix use-after-free in ipc_msg_send_request

ipc_msg_send_request() waits for a generic netlink reply using an
ipc_msg_table_entry on the stack. The generic netlink handler
(handle_generic_event()/handle_response()) fills entry->response under
ipc_msg_table_lock, but ipc_msg_send_request() used to validate and free
entry->response without holding the same lock.

Under high concurrency this allows a race where handle_response() is
copying data into entry->response while ipc_msg_send_request() has just
freed it, leading to a slab-use-after-free reported by KASAN in
handle_generic_event():

  BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in handle_generic_event+0x3c4/0x5f0 [ksmbd]

  Freed by task:

Fix by:
- Taking ipc_msg_table_lock in ipc_msg_send_request() while validating
  entry->response, freeing it when invalid, and removing the entry from
  ipc_msg_table.
- Returning the final entry->response pointer to the caller only after
  the hash entry is removed under the lock.
- Returning NULL in the error path, preserving the original API
  semantics.

This makes all accesses to entry->response consistent with
handle_response(), which already updates and fills the response buffer
under ipc_msg_table_lock, and closes the race that allowed the UAF.

## AP-CVE-2025-68264 : CVE-2025-68264 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: refresh inline data size before write operations

The cached ei->i_inline_size can become stale between the initial size
check and when ext4_update_inline_data()/ext4_create_inline_data() use
it. Although ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads the correct value at the
time of the check, concurrent xattr operations can modify i_inline_size
before ext4_write_lock_xattr() is acquired.

This causes ext4_update_inline_data() and ext4_create_inline_data() to
work with stale capacity values, leading to a BUG_ON() crash in
ext4_write_inline_data():

  kernel BUG at fs/ext4/inline.c:1331!
  BUG_ON(pos + len > EXT4_I(inode)->i_inline_size);

The race window:
1. ext4_get_max_inline_size() reads i_inline_size = 60 (correct)
2. Size check passes for 50-byte write
3. [Another thread adds xattr, i_inline_size changes to 40]
4. ext4_write_lock_xattr() acquires lock
5. ext4_update_inline_data() uses stale i_inline_size = 60
6. Attempts to write 50 bytes but only 40 bytes actually available
7. BUG_ON() triggers

Fix this by recalculating i_inline_size via ext4_find_inline_data_nolock()
immediately after acquiring xattr_sem. This ensures ext4_update_inline_data()
and ext4_create_inline_data() work with current values that are protected
from concurrent modifications.

This is similar to commit a54c4613dac1 ("ext4: fix race writing to an
inline_data file while its xattrs are changing") which fixed i_inline_off
staleness. This patch addresses the related i_inline_size staleness issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-68266 : CVE-2025-68266 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bfs: Reconstruct file type when loading from disk

syzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when
the S_IFMT bits of the 32bits "mode" field loaded from disk are corrupted
or when the 32bits "attributes" field loaded from disk are corrupted.

A documentation says that BFS uses only lower 9 bits of the "mode" field.
But I can't find an explicit explanation that the unused upper 23 bits
(especially, the S_IFMT bits) are initialized with 0.

Therefore, ignore the S_IFMT bits of the "mode" field loaded from disk.
Also, verify that the value of the "attributes" field loaded from disk is
either BFS_VREG or BFS_VDIR (because BFS supports only regular files and
the root directory).

## AP-CVE-2025-68291 : CVE-2025-68291 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: Initialise rcv_mss before calling tcp_send_active_reset() in mptcp_do_fastclose().

syzbot reported divide-by-zero in __tcp_select_window() by
MPTCP socket. [0]

We had a similar issue for the bare TCP and fixed in commit
499350a5a6e7 ("tcp: initialize rcv_mss to TCP_MIN_MSS instead
of 0").

Let's apply the same fix to mptcp_do_fastclose().

## AP-CVE-2025-68325 : CVE-2025-68325 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_cake: Fix incorrect qlen reduction in cake_drop

In cake_drop(), qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is used to update the qlen
and backlog of the qdisc hierarchy. Its caller, cake_enqueue(), assumes
that the parent qdisc will enqueue the current packet. However, this
assumption breaks when cake_enqueue() returns NET_XMIT_CN: the parent
qdisc stops enqueuing current packet, leaving the tree qlen/backlog
accounting inconsistent. This mismatch can lead to a NULL dereference
(e.g., when the parent Qdisc is qfq_qdisc).

This patch computes the qlen/backlog delta in a more robust way by
observing the difference before and after the series of cake_drop()
calls, and then compensates the qdisc tree accounting if cake_enqueue()
returns NET_XMIT_CN.

To ensure correct compensation when ACK thinning is enabled, a new
variable is introduced to keep qlen unchanged.

## AP-CVE-2025-65562 : CVE-2025-65562 Exploitation
Description: The free5GC UPF suffers from a lack of bounds checking on the SEID when processing PFCP Session Deletion Requests. An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a request with a very large SEID (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) that causes an integer conversion/underflow in LocalNode.DeleteSess() / LocalNode.Sess() when a uint64 SEID is converted to int and used in index arithmetic. This leads to a negative index into n.sess and a Go runtime panic, resulting in a denial of service (UPF crash). The issue has been reproduced on free5GC v4.1.0 with crashes observed in the session lookup/deletion path in internal/pfcp/node.go; other versions may also be affected. No authentication is required.

## AP-CVE-2025-65566 : CVE-2025-65566 Exploitation
Description: A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the omec-project UPF (pfcpiface component) in version upf-epc-pfcpiface:2.1.3-dev. When the UPF receives a PFCP Session Report Response that is missing the mandatory Cause Information Element, the session report handler dereferences a nil pointer instead of rejecting the malformed message. This triggers a panic and terminates the UPF process. An attacker who can send PFCP Session Report Response messages to the UPF's N4/PFCP endpoint can exploit this flaw to repeatedly crash the UPF and disrupt user-plane services.

## AP-CVE-2025-68161 : CVE-2025-68161 Exploitation
Description: The Socket Appender in Apache Log4j Core versions 2.0-beta9 through 2.25.2 does not perform TLS hostname verification of the peer certificate, even when the  verifyHostName https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders/network.html#SslConfiguration-attr-verifyHostName  configuration attribute or the  log4j2.sslVerifyHostName https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/systemproperties.html#log4j2.sslVerifyHostName  system property is set to true.

This issue may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to intercept or redirect log traffic under the following conditions:

  *  The attacker is able to intercept or redirect network traffic between the client and the log receiver.
  *  The attacker can present a server certificate issued by a certification authority trusted by the Socket Appender’s configured trust store (or by the default Java trust store if no custom trust store is configured).


Users are advised to upgrade to Apache Log4j Core version 2.25.3, which addresses this issue.

As an alternative mitigation, the Socket Appender may be configured to use a private or restricted trust root to limit the set of trusted certificates.

## AP-CVE-2025-66524 : CVE-2025-66524 Exploitation
Description: Apache NiFi 1.20.0 through 2.6.0 include the GetAsanaObject Processor, which requires integration with a configurable Distribute Map Cache Client Service for storing and retrieving state information. The GetAsanaObject Processor used generic Java Object serialization and deserialization without filtering. Unfiltered Java object deserialization does not provide protection against crafted state information stored in the cache server configured for GetAsanaObject. Exploitation requires an Apache NiFi system running with the GetAsanaObject Processor, and direct access to the configured cache server. Upgrading to Apache NiFi 2.7.0 is the recommended mitigation, which replaces Java Object serialization with JSON serialization. Removing the GetAsanaObject Processor located in the nifi-asana-processors-nar bundle also prevents exploitation.

## AP-CVE-2025-68457 : CVE-2025-68457 Exploitation
Description: Orejime is a consent manager that focuses on accessibility. On HTML elements handled by Orejime prior to version 2.3.2, one could run malicious code by embedding `javascript:` code within data attributes. When consenting to the related purpose, Orejime would turn data attributes into unprefixed ones (i.e. `data-href` into `href`), thus executing the code. This shouldn't have any impact on most setups, as elements handled by Orejime are generally hardcoded. The problem would only arise if somebody could inject HTML code within pages. The problem has been patched in version 2.3.2. As a workaround, the problem can be fixed outside of Orejime by sanitizing attributes which could contain executable code.

comedi: c6xdigio: Fix invalid PNP driver unregistration

The Comedi low-level driver "c6xdigio" seems to be for a parallel port
connected device.  When the Comedi core calls the driver's Comedi
"attach" handler `c6xdigio_attach()` to configure a Comedi to use this
driver, it tries to enable the parallel port PNP resources by
registering a PNP driver with `pnp_register_driver()`, but ignores the
return value.  (The `struct pnp_driver` it uses has only the `name` and
`id_table` members filled in.)  The driver's Comedi "detach" handler
`c6xdigio_detach()` unconditionally unregisters the PNP driver with
`pnp_unregister_driver()`.

It is possible for `c6xdigio_attach()` to return an error before it
calls `pnp_register_driver()` and it is possible for the call to
`pnp_register_driver()` to return an error (that is ignored).  In both
cases, the driver should not be calling `pnp_unregister_driver()` as it
does in `c6xdigio_detach()`.  (Note that `c6xdigio_detach()` will be
called by the Comedi core if `c6xdigio_attach()` returns an error, or if
the Comedi core decides to detach the Comedi device from the driver for
some other reason.)

The unconditional call to `pnp_unregister_driver()` without a previous
successful call to `pnp_register_driver()` will cause
`driver_unregister()` to issue a warning "Unexpected driver
unregister!".  This was detected by Syzbot [1].

Also, the PNP driver registration and unregistration should be done at
module init and exit time, respectively, not when attaching or detaching
Comedi devices to the driver.  (There might be more than one Comedi
device being attached to the driver, although that is unlikely.)

Change the driver to do the PNP driver registration at module init time,
and the unregistration at module exit time.  Since `c6xdigio_detach()`
now only calls `comedi_legacy_detach()`, remove the function and change
the Comedi driver "detach" handler to `comedi_legacy_detach`.

## AP-CVE-2025-68335 : CVE-2025-68335 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: pcl818: fix null-ptr-deref in pcl818_ai_cancel()

Syzbot identified an issue [1] in pcl818_ai_cancel(), which stems from
the fact that in case of early device detach via pcl818_detach(),
subdevice dev->read_subdev may not have initialized its pointer to
&struct comedi_async as intended. Thus, any such dereferencing of
&s->async->cmd will lead to general protection fault and kernel crash.

Mitigate this problem by removing a call to pcl818_ai_cancel() from
pcl818_detach() altogether. This way, if the subdevice setups its
support for async commands, everything async-related will be
handled via subdevice's own ->cancel() function in
comedi_device_detach_locked() even before pcl818_detach(). If no
support for asynchronous commands is provided, there is no need
to cancel anything either.

The above issue occurs with us in errors=continue mode when accompanied by
storage failures. There have been many inconsistencies in the file system
data.
In the case of file system data inconsistency, for example, if the block
bitmap of a referenced block is not set, it can lead to the situation where
a block being committed is allocated and used again. As a result, the
following condition will not be satisfied then trigger BUG_ON. Of course,
it is entirely possible to construct a problematic image that can trigger
this BUG_ON through specific operations. In fact, I have constructed such
an image and easily reproduced this issue.
Therefore, J_ASSERT() holds true only under ideal conditions, but it may
not necessarily be satisfied in exceptional scenarios. Using J_ASSERT()
directly in abnormal situations would cause the system to crash, which is
clearly not what we want. So here we directly trigger a JBD abort instead
of immediately invoking BUG_ON.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: cs35l41: Fix NULL pointer dereference in cs35l41_hda_read_acpi()

The acpi_get_first_physical_node() function can return NULL, in which
case the get_device() function also returns NULL, but this value is
then dereferenced without checking,so add a check to prevent a crash.

## AP-CVE-2025-68346 : CVE-2025-68346 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: dice: fix buffer overflow in detect_stream_formats()

The function detect_stream_formats() reads the stream_count value directly
from a FireWire device without validating it. This can lead to
out-of-bounds writes when a malicious device provides a stream_count value
greater than MAX_STREAMS.

Fix by applying the same validation to both TX and RX stream counts in
detect_stream_formats().

## AP-CVE-2025-68347 : CVE-2025-68347 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: firewire-motu: fix buffer overflow in hwdep read for DSP events

The DSP event handling code in hwdep_read() could write more bytes to
the user buffer than requested, when a user provides a buffer smaller
than the event header size (8 bytes).

Fix by using min_t() to clamp the copy size, This ensures we never copy
more than the user requested.

Fixes a crash when layout is null during this call stack:

write_inode
    -> nfs4_write_inode
        -> pnfs_layoutcommit_inode

pnfs_set_layoutcommit relies on the lseg refcount to keep the layout
around. Need to clear NFS_INO_LAYOUTCOMMIT otherwise we might attempt
to reference a null layout.

regulator_supply_alias_list was accessed without any locking in
regulator_supply_alias(), regulator_register_supply_alias(), and
regulator_unregister_supply_alias(). Concurrent registration,
unregistration and lookups can race, leading to:

1 use-after-free if an alias entry is removed while being read,
2 duplicate entries when two threads register the same alias,
3 inconsistent alias mappings observed by consumers.

Protect all traversals, insertions and deletions on
regulator_supply_alias_list with the existing regulator_list_mutex.

Since commit 222f2c7c6d14 ("iomap: always run error completions in user
context"), read error completions are deferred to s_dio_done_wq.  This
means the workqueue also needs to be allocated for async reads.

## AP-CVE-2025-68362 : CVE-2025-68362 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtl818x: rtl8187: Fix potential buffer underflow in rtl8187_rx_cb()

The rtl8187_rx_cb() calculates the rx descriptor header address
by subtracting its size from the skb tail pointer.
However, it does not validate if the received packet
(skb->len from urb->actual_length) is large enough to contain this
header.

If a truncated packet is received, this will lead to a buffer
underflow, reading memory before the start of the skb data area,
and causing a kernel panic.

Add length checks for both rtl8187 and rtl8187b descriptor headers
before attempting to access them, dropping the packet cleanly if the
check fails.

## AP-CVE-2025-68363 : CVE-2025-68363 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check skb->transport_header is set in bpf_skb_check_mtu

The bpf_skb_check_mtu helper needs to use skb->transport_header when
the BPF_MTU_CHK_SEGS flag is used:

	bpf_skb_check_mtu(skb, ifindex, &mtu_len, 0, BPF_MTU_CHK_SEGS)

The transport_header is not always set. There is a WARN_ON_ONCE
report when CONFIG_DEBUG_NET is enabled + skb->gso_size is set +
bpf_prog_test_run is used:

WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2216 at ./include/linux/skbuff.h:3071

 bpf_prog_3920e25740a41171_tc_chk_segs_flag # A test in the next patch
 bpf_test_run
 bpf_prog_test_run_skb

For a normal ingress skb (not test_run), skb_reset_transport_header
is performed but there is plan to avoid setting it as described in
commit 2170a1f09148 ("net: no longer reset transport_header in __netif_receive_skb_core()").

This patch fixes the bpf helper by checking
skb_transport_header_was_set(). The check is done just before
skb->transport_header is used, to avoid breaking the existing bpf prog.
The WARN_ON_ONCE is limited to bpf_prog_test_run, so targeting bpf-next.

## AP-CVE-2025-68371 : CVE-2025-68371 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: smartpqi: Fix device resources accessed after device removal

Correct possible race conditions during device removal.

Previously, a scheduled work item to reset a LUN could still execute
after the device was removed, leading to use-after-free and other
resource access issues.

This race condition occurs because the abort handler may schedule a LUN
reset concurrently with device removal via sdev_destroy(), leading to
use-after-free and improper access to freed resources.

  - Check in the device reset handler if the device is still present in
    the controller's SCSI device list before running; if not, the reset
    is skipped.

  - Cancel any pending TMF work that has not started in sdev_destroy().

  - Ensure device freeing in sdev_destroy() is done while holding the
    LUN reset mutex to avoid races with ongoing resets.

## AP-CVE-2025-68372 : CVE-2025-68372 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: defer config put in recv_work

There is one uaf issue in recv_work when running NBD_CLEAR_SOCK and
NBD_CMD_RECONFIGURE:
  nbd_genl_connect     // conf_ref=2 (connect and recv_work A)
  nbd_open	       // conf_ref=3
  recv_work A done     // conf_ref=2
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK       // conf_ref=1
  nbd_genl_reconfigure // conf_ref=2 (trigger recv_work B)
  close nbd	       // conf_ref=1
  recv_work B
    config_put         // conf_ref=0
    atomic_dec(&config->recv_threads); -> UAF

Or only running NBD_CLEAR_SOCK:
  nbd_genl_connect   // conf_ref=2
  nbd_open 	     // conf_ref=3
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK     // conf_ref=2
  close nbd
    nbd_release
      config_put     // conf_ref=1
  recv_work
    config_put 	     // conf_ref=0
    atomic_dec(&config->recv_threads); -> UAF

Commit 87aac3a80af5 ("nbd: call nbd_config_put() before notifying the
waiter") moved nbd_config_put() to run before waking up the waiter in
recv_work, in order to ensure that nbd_start_device_ioctl() would not
be woken up while nbd->task_recv was still uncleared.

However, in nbd_start_device_ioctl(), after being woken up it explicitly
calls flush_workqueue() to make sure all current works are finished.
Therefore, there is no need to move the config put ahead of the wakeup.

Move nbd_config_put() to the end of recv_work, so that the reference is
held for the whole lifetime of the worker thread. This makes sure the
config cannot be freed while recv_work is still running, even if clear
+ reconfigure interleave.

In addition, we don't need to worry about recv_work dropping the last
nbd_put (which causes deadlock):

path A (netlink with NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):
  connect  // nbd_refs=1 (trigger recv_work)
  open nbd // nbd_refs=2
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK
  close nbd
    nbd_release
      nbd_disconnect_and_put
        flush_workqueue // recv_work done
      nbd_config_put
        nbd_put // nbd_refs=1
      nbd_put // nbd_refs=0
        queue_work

path B (netlink without NBD_CFLAG_DESTROY_ON_DISCONNECT):
  connect  // nbd_refs=2 (trigger recv_work)
  open nbd // nbd_refs=3
  NBD_CLEAR_SOCK // conf_refs=2
  close nbd
    nbd_release
      nbd_config_put // conf_refs=1
      nbd_put // nbd_refs=2
  recv_work done // conf_refs=0, nbd_refs=1
  rmmod // nbd_refs=0

A NULL pointer dereference can occur in rxe_srq_chk_attr() when
ibv_modify_srq() is invoked twice in succession under certain error
conditions. The first call may fail in rxe_queue_resize(), which leads
rxe_srq_from_attr() to set srq->rq.queue = NULL. The second call then
triggers a crash (null deref) when accessing
srq->rq.queue->buf->index_mask.

## AP-CVE-2025-68380 : CVE-2025-68380 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix peer HE MCS assignment

In ath11k_wmi_send_peer_assoc_cmd(), peer's transmit MCS is sent to
firmware as receive MCS while peer's receive MCS sent as transmit MCS,
which goes against firmwire's definition.

While connecting to a misbehaved AP that advertises 0xffff (meaning not
supported) for 160 MHz transmit MCS map, firmware crashes due to 0xffff
is assigned to he_mcs->rx_mcs_set field.

	Ext Tag: HE Capabilities
	    [...]
	    Supported HE-MCS and NSS Set
		[...]
	        Rx and Tx MCS Maps 160 MHz
		    [...]
	            Tx HE-MCS Map 160 MHz: 0xffff

Swap the assignment to fix this issue.

As the HE rate control mask is meant to limit our own transmit MCS, it
needs to go via he_mcs->rx_mcs_set field. With the aforementioned swapping
done, change is needed as well to apply it to the peer's receive MCS.

ntfs_get_bh() expects a buffer from sb_getblk(), that buffer may not be
uptodate. We do not bring the buffer uptodate before setting it as
uptodate. If the buffer were to not be uptodate, it could mean adding a
buffer with un-init data to the mi record. Attempting to load that record
will trigger KMSAN.

Avoid this by setting the buffer as uptodate, if it’s not already, by
overwriting it.

## AP-CVE-2025-68740 : CVE-2025-68740 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ima: Handle error code returned by ima_filter_rule_match()

In ima_match_rules(), if ima_filter_rule_match() returns -ENOENT due to
the rule being NULL, the function incorrectly skips the 'if (!rc)' check
and sets 'result = true'. The LSM rule is considered a match, causing
extra files to be measured by IMA.

This issue can be reproduced in the following scenario:
After unloading the SELinux policy module via 'semodule -d', if an IMA
measurement is triggered before ima_lsm_rules is updated,
in ima_match_rules(), the first call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns
-ESTALE. This causes the code to enter the 'if (rc == -ESTALE &&
!rule_reinitialized)' block, perform ima_lsm_copy_rule() and retry. In
ima_lsm_copy_rule(), since the SELinux module has been removed, the rule
becomes NULL, and the second call to ima_filter_rule_match() returns
-ENOENT. This bypasses the 'if (!rc)' check and results in a false match.

## AP-CVE-2025-68741 : CVE-2025-68741 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix improper freeing of purex item

In qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb(), an item is allocated via
qla27xx_copy_multiple_pkt(), which internally calls
qla24xx_alloc_purex_item().

The qla24xx_alloc_purex_item() function may return a pre-allocated item
from a per-adapter pool for small allocations, instead of dynamically
allocating memory with kzalloc().

An error handling path in qla2xxx_process_purls_iocb() incorrectly uses
kfree() to release the item. If the item was from the pre-allocated
pool, calling kfree() on it is a bug that can lead to memory corruption.

Fix this by using the correct deallocation function,
qla24xx_free_purex_item(), which properly handles both dynamically
allocated and pre-allocated items.

## AP-CVE-2025-68742 : CVE-2025-68742 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix invalid prog->stats access when update_effective_progs fails

Syzkaller triggers an invalid memory access issue following fault
injection in update_effective_progs. The issue can be described as
follows:

__cgroup_bpf_detach
  update_effective_progs
    compute_effective_progs
      bpf_prog_array_alloc <-- fault inject
  purge_effective_progs
    /* change to dummy_bpf_prog */
    array->items[index] = &dummy_bpf_prog.prog

---softirq start---
__do_softirq
  ...
    __cgroup_bpf_run_filter_skb
      __bpf_prog_run_save_cb
        bpf_prog_run
          stats = this_cpu_ptr(prog->stats)
          /* invalid memory access */
          flags = u64_stats_update_begin_irqsave(&stats->syncp)
---softirq end---

  static_branch_dec(&cgroup_bpf_enabled_key[atype])

The reason is that fault injection caused update_effective_progs to fail
and then changed the original prog into dummy_bpf_prog.prog in
purge_effective_progs. Then a softirq came, and accessing the members of
dummy_bpf_prog.prog in the softirq triggers invalid mem access.

To fix it, skip updating stats when stats is NULL.

As [lru_,]percpu_hash maps support BPF_KPTR_{REF,PERCPU}, missing
calls to 'bpf_obj_free_fields()' in 'pcpu_copy_value()' could cause the
memory referenced by BPF_KPTR_{REF,PERCPU} fields to be held until the
map gets freed.

Fix this by calling 'bpf_obj_free_fields()' after
'copy_map_value[,_long]()' in 'pcpu_copy_value()'.

## AP-CVE-2025-68746 : CVE-2025-68746 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: tegra210-quad: Fix timeout handling

When the CPU that the QSPI interrupt handler runs on (typically CPU 0)
is excessively busy, it can lead to rare cases of the IRQ thread not
running before the transfer timeout is reached.

While handling the timeouts, any pending transfers are cleaned up and
the message that they correspond to is marked as failed, which leaves
the curr_xfer field pointing at stale memory.

To avoid this, clear curr_xfer to NULL upon timeout and check for this
condition when the IRQ thread is finally run.

While at it, also make sure to clear interrupts on failure so that new
interrupts can be run.

A better, more involved, fix would move the interrupt clearing into a
hard IRQ handler. Ideally we would also want to signal that the IRQ
thread no longer needs to be run after the timeout is hit to avoid the
extra check for a valid transfer.

## AP-CVE-2025-68700 : CVE-2025-68700 Exploitation
Description: RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In versions prior to 0.23.0, a low-privileged authenticated user (normal login account) can execute arbitrary system commands on the server host process via the frontend Canvas CodeExec component, completely bypassing sandbox isolation. This occurs because untrusted data (stdout) is parsed using eval() with no filtering or sandboxing. The intended design was to "automatically convert string results into Python objects," but this effectively executes attacker-controlled code. Additional endpoints lack access control or contain inverted permission logic, significantly expanding the attack surface and enabling chained exploitation. Version 0.23.0 contains a patch for the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-69286 : CVE-2025-69286 Exploitation
Description: RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine. In versions prior to 0.22.0, the use of an insecure key generation algorithm in the API key and beta (assistant/agent share auth) token generation process allows these tokens to be mutually derivable. Specifically, both tokens are generated using the same `URLSafeTimedSerializer` with predictable inputs, enabling an unauthorized user who obtains the shared assistant/agent URL to derive the personal API key. This grants them full control over the assistant/agent owner's account. Version 0.22.0 fixes the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-68619 : CVE-2025-68619 Exploitation
Description: Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Versions prior to 2.19.0 of the appstore interface allow administrators to install npm packages through a REST API endpoint. While the endpoint validates that the package name exists in the npm registry as a known plugin or webapp, the version parameter accepts arbitrary npm version specifiers including URLs. npm supports installing packages from git repositories, GitHub shorthand syntax, and HTTP/HTTPS URLs pointing to tarballs. When npm installs a package, it can automatically execute any `postinstall` script defined in `package.json`, enabling arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability exists because npm's version specifier syntax is extremely flexible, and the SignalK code passes the version parameter directly to npm without sanitization. An attacker with admin access can install a package from an attacker-controlled source containing a malicious `postinstall` script. Version 2.19.0 contains a patch for the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-68620 : CVE-2025-68620 Exploitation
Description: Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Versions prior to 2.19.0 expose two features that can be chained together to steal JWT authentication tokens without any prior authentication. The attack combines WebSocket-based request enumeration with unauthenticated polling of access request status. The first is Unauthenticated WebSocket Request Enumeration: When a WebSocket client connects to the SignalK stream endpoint with the `serverevents=all` query parameter, the server sends all cached server events including `ACCESS_REQUEST` events that contain details about pending access requests. The `startServerEvents` function iterates over `app.lastServerEvents` and writes each cached event to any connected client without verifying authorization level. Since WebSocket connections are allowed for readonly users (which includes unauthenticated users when `allow_readonly` is true), attackers receive these events containing request IDs, client identifiers, descriptions, requested permissions, and IP addresses. The second is Unauthenticated Token Polling: The access request status endpoint at `/signalk/v1/access/requests/:id` returns the full state of an access request without requiring authentication. When an administrator approves a request, the response includes the issued JWT token in plaintext. The `queryRequest` function returns the complete request object including the token field, and the REST endpoint uses readonly authentication, allowing unauthenticated access. An attacker has two paths to exploit these vulnerabilities. Either the attacker creates their own access request (using the IP spoofing vulnerability to craft a convincing spoofed request), then polls their own request ID until an administrator approves it, receiving the JWT token; or the attacker passively monitors the WebSocket stream to discover request IDs from legitimate devices, then polls those IDs and steals the JWT tokens when administrators approve them, hijacking legitimate device credentials. Both paths require zero authentication and enable complete authentication bypass. Version 2.19.0 fixes the underlying issues.

## AP-CVE-2025-69203 : CVE-2025-69203 Exploitation
Description: Signal K Server is a server application that runs on a central hub in a boat. Versions prior to 2.19.0 of the access request system have two related features that when combined by themselves and with an information disclosure vulnerability enable convincing social engineering attacks against administrators. When a device creates an access request, it specifies three fields: `clientId`, `description`, and `permissions`. The SignalK admin UI displays the `description` field prominently to the administrator when showing pending requests, but the actual `permissions` field (which determines the access level granted) is less visible or displayed separately. This allows an attacker to request `admin` permissions while providing a description that suggests readonly access. The access request handler trusts the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header without validation to determine the client's IP address. This header is intended to preserve the original client IP when requests pass through reverse proxies, but when trusted unconditionally, it allows attackers to spoof their IP address. The spoofed IP is displayed to administrators in the access request approval interface, potentially making malicious requests appear to originate from trusted internal network addresses. Since device/source names can be enumerated via the information disclosure vulnerability, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate device or source, craft a convincing description, spoof a trusted internal IP address, and request elevated permissions, creating a highly convincing social engineering scenario that increases the likelihood of administrator approval. Users should upgrade to version 2.19.0 to fix this issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-67268 : CVE-2025-67268 Exploitation
Description: gpsd before commit dc966aa contains a heap-based out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the drivers/driver_nmea2000.c file. The hnd_129540 function, which handles NMEA2000 PGN 129540 (GNSS Satellites in View) packets, fails to validate the user-supplied satellite count against the size of the skyview array (184 elements). This allows an attacker to write beyond the bounds of the array by providing a satellite count up to 255, leading to memory corruption, Denial of Service (DoS), and potentially arbitrary code execution.

## AP-CVE-2025-67269 : CVE-2025-67269 Exploitation
Description: An integer underflow vulnerability exists in the `nextstate()` function in `gpsd/packet.c` of gpsd versions prior to commit `ffa1d6f40bca0b035fc7f5e563160ebb67199da7`. When parsing a NAVCOM packet, the payload length is calculated using `lexer->length = (size_t)c - 4` without checking if the input byte `c` is less than 4. This results in an unsigned integer underflow, setting `lexer->length` to a very large value (near `SIZE_MAX`). The parser then enters a loop attempting to consume this massive number of bytes, causing 100% CPU utilization and a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Description: CasaOS versions up to and including 0.4.15 expose multiple unauthenticated endpoints that allow remote attackers to retrieve sensitive configuration files and system debug information. The /v1/users/image endpoint can be abused with a user-controlled path parameter to access files under /var/lib/casaos/1/, which reveals installed applications and configuration details. Additionally, /v1/sys/debug discloses host operating system, kernel, hardware, and storage information. The endpoints also return distinct error messages, enabling file existence enumeration of arbitrary paths on the underlying host filesystem. This information disclosure can be used for reconnaissance and to facilitate targeted follow-up attacks against services deployed on the host.

## AP-CVE-2026-21451 : CVE-2026-21451 Exploitation
Description: Bagisto is an open source laravel eCommerce platform. A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Bagisto prior to version 2.3.10 within the CMS page editor. Although the platform normally attempts to sanitize `<script>` tags, the filtering can be bypassed by manipulating the raw HTTP POST request before submission. As a result, arbitrary JavaScript can be stored in the CMS content and executed whenever the page is viewed or edited. This exposes administrators to a high-severity risk, including complete account takeover, backend hijacking, and malicious script execution. Version 2.3.10 fixes the issue.

## AP-CVE-2026-21452 : CVE-2026-21452 Exploitation
Description: MessagePack for Java is a serializer implementation for Java. A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in versions prior to 0.9.11 when deserializing .msgpack files containing EXT32 objects with attacker-controlled payload lengths. While MessagePack-Java parses extension headers lazily, it later trusts the declared EXT payload length when materializing the extension data. When ExtensionValue.getData() is invoked, the library attempts to allocate a byte array of the declared length without enforcing any upper bound. A malicious .msgpack file of only a few bytes can therefore trigger unbounded heap allocation, resulting in JVM heap exhaustion, process termination, or service unavailability. This vulnerability is triggered during model loading / deserialization, making it a model format vulnerability suitable for remote exploitation. The vulnerability enables a remote denial-of-service attack against applications that deserialize untrusted .msgpack model files using MessagePack for Java. A specially crafted but syntactically valid .msgpack file containing an EXT32 object with an attacker-controlled, excessively large payload length can trigger unbounded memory allocation during deserialization. When the model file is loaded, the library trusts the declared length metadata and attempts to allocate a byte array of that size, leading to rapid heap exhaustion, excessive garbage collection, or immediate JVM termination with an OutOfMemoryError. The attack requires no malformed bytes, user interaction, or elevated privileges and can be exploited remotely in real-world environments such as model registries, inference services, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud-based model hosting platforms that accept or fetch .msgpack artifacts. Because the malicious file is extremely small yet valid, it can bypass basic validation and scanning mechanisms, resulting in complete service unavailability and potential cascading failures in production systems. Version 0.9.11 fixes the vulnerability.

Description: listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager. Prior to version 6.0.0, lower-privileged user with campaign management permissions can inject malicious JavaScript into campaigns or templates. When a higher-privileged user (Super Admin) views or previews this content, the XSS executes in their browser context, allowing the attacker to perform privileged actions such as creating backdoor admin accounts. The attack can be weaponized via the public archive feature, where victims simply need to visit a link - no preview click required. Version 6.0.0 fixes the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-15022 : CVE-2025-15022 Exploitation
Description: Action captions in Vaadin accept HTML by default but were not sanitized, potentially allowing Cross-site Scripting (XSS) if caption content is derived from user input.

In Vaadin Framework 7 and 8, the Action class is a general-purpose class that may be used by multiple components. The fixed versions sanitize captions by default and provide an API to explicitly enable HTML content mode for backwards compatibility.

In Vaadin 23 and newer, the Action class is only used by the Spreadsheet component. The fixed versions sanitize HTML using Jsoup with a relaxed safelist.

Vaadin 14 is not affected as Spreadsheet component was not supported.

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation or upgrade. Releases that have fixed this issue include:

## AP-CVE-2025-68751 : CVE-2025-68751 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/fpu: Fix false-positive kmsan report in fpu_vstl()

A false-positive kmsan report is detected when running ping command.

An inline assembly instruction 'vstl' can write varied amount of bytes
depending on value of 'index' argument. If 'index' > 0, 'vstl' writes
at least 2 bytes.

clang generates kmsan write helper call depending on inline assembly
constraints. Constraints are evaluated compile-time, but value of
'index' argument is known only at runtime.

clang currently generates call to __msan_instrument_asm_store with 1 byte
as size. Manually call kmsan function to indicate correct amount of bytes
written and fix false-positive report.

This change fixes following kmsan reports:

## AP-CVE-2025-68755 : CVE-2025-68755 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: most: remove broken i2c driver

The MOST I2C driver has been completely broken for five years without
anyone noticing so remove the driver from staging.

Specifically, commit 723de0f9171e ("staging: most: remove device from
interface structure") started requiring drivers to set the interface
device pointer before registration, but the I2C driver was never updated
which results in a NULL pointer dereference if anyone ever tries to
probe it.

## AP-CVE-2025-68756 : CVE-2025-68756 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Use RCU in blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset() instead of set->tag_list_lock

blk_mq_{add,del}_queue_tag_set() functions add and remove queues from
tagset, the functions make sure that tagset and queues are marked as
shared when two or more queues are attached to the same tagset.
Initially a tagset starts as unshared and when the number of added
queues reaches two, blk_mq_add_queue_tag_set() marks it as shared along
with all the queues attached to it. When the number of attached queues
drops to 1 blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set() need to mark both the tagset and
the remaining queues as unshared.

Both functions need to freeze current queues in tagset before setting on
unsetting BLK_MQ_F_TAG_QUEUE_SHARED flag. While doing so, both functions
hold set->tag_list_lock mutex, which makes sense as we do not want
queues to be added or deleted in the process. This used to work fine
until commit 98d81f0df70c ("nvme: use blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset")
made the nvme driver quiesce tagset instead of quiscing individual
queues. blk_mq_quiesce_tagset() does the job and quiesce the queues in
set->tag_list while holding set->tag_list_lock also.

This results in deadlock between two threads with these stacktraces:

The top stacktrace is showing nvme_timeout() called to handle nvme
command timeout. timeout handler is trying to disable the controller and
as a first step, it needs to blk_mq_quiesce_tagset() to tell blk-mq not
to call queue callback handlers. The thread is stuck waiting for
set->tag_list_lock as it tries to walk the queues in set->tag_list.

The lock is held by the second thread in the bottom stack which is
waiting for one of queues to be frozen. The queue usage counter will
drop to zero after nvme_timeout() finishes, and this will not happen
because the thread will wait for this mutex forever.

Given that [un]quiescing queue is an operation that does not need to
sleep, update blk_mq_[un]quiesce_tagset() to use RCU instead of taking
set->tag_list_lock, update blk_mq_{add,del}_queue_tag_set() to use RCU
safe list operations. Also, delete INIT_LIST_HEAD(&q->tag_set_list)
in blk_mq_del_queue_tag_set() because we can not re-initialize it while
the list is being traversed under RCU. The deleted queue will not be
added/deleted to/from a tagset and it will be freed in blk_free_queue()
after the end of RCU grace period.

## AP-CVE-2025-68757 : CVE-2025-68757 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vgem-fence: Fix potential deadlock on release

A timer that expires a vgem fence automatically in 10 seconds is now
released with timer_delete_sync() from fence->ops.release() called on last
dma_fence_put().  In some scenarios, it can run in IRQ context, which is
not safe unless TIMER_IRQSAFE is used.  One potentially risky scenario was
demonstrated in Intel DRM CI trybot, BAT run on machine bat-adlp-6, while
working on new IGT subtests syncobj_timeline@stress-* as user space
replacements of some problematic test cases of a dma-fence-chain selftest

## AP-CVE-2025-68758 : CVE-2025-68758 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

backlight: led-bl: Add devlink to supplier LEDs

LED Backlight is a consumer of one or multiple LED class devices, but
devlink is currently unable to create correct supplier-producer links when
the supplier is a class device. It creates instead a link where the
supplier is the parent of the expected device.

One consequence is that removal order is not correctly enforced.

Issues happen for example with the following sections in a device tree
overlay:

    // An LED driver chip
    pca9632@62 {
        compatible = "nxp,pca9632";
        reg = <0x62>;

	// ...

        addon_led_pwm: led-pwm@3 {
            reg = <3>;
            label = "addon:led:pwm";
        };
    };

    backlight-addon {
        compatible = "led-backlight";
        leds = <&addon_led_pwm>;
        brightness-levels = <255>;
        default-brightness-level = <255>;
    };

In this example, the devlink should be created between the backlight-addon
(consumer) and the pca9632@62 (supplier). Instead it is created between the
backlight-addon (consumer) and the parent of the pca9632@62, which is
typically the I2C bus adapter.

On removal of the above overlay, the LED driver can be removed before the
backlight device, resulting in:

    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010
    ...
    Call trace:
     led_put+0xe0/0x140
     devm_led_release+0x6c/0x98

Another way to reproduce the bug without any device tree overlays is
unbinding the LED class device (pca9632@62) before unbinding the consumer
(backlight-addon):

  echo 11-0062 >/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/leds-pca963x/unbind
  echo ...backlight-dock >/sys/bus/platform/drivers/led-backlight/unbind

Fix by adding a devlink between the consuming led-backlight device and the
supplying LED device, as other drivers and subsystems do as well.

## AP-CVE-2025-68759 : CVE-2025-68759 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtl818x: Fix potential memory leaks in rtl8180_init_rx_ring()

In rtl8180_init_rx_ring(), memory is allocated for skb packets and DMA
allocations in a loop. When an allocation fails, the previously
successful allocations are not freed on exit.

Fix that by jumping to err_free_rings label on error, which calls
rtl8180_free_rx_ring() to free the allocations. Remove the free of
rx_ring in rtl8180_init_rx_ring() error path, and set the freed
priv->rx_buf entry to null, to avoid double free.

## AP-CVE-2025-68760 : CVE-2025-68760 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/amd: Fix potential out-of-bounds read in iommu_mmio_show

In iommu_mmio_write(), it validates the user-provided offset with the
check: `iommu->dbg_mmio_offset > iommu->mmio_phys_end - 4`.
This assumes a 4-byte access. However, the corresponding
show handler, iommu_mmio_show(), uses readq() to perform an 8-byte
(64-bit) read.

If a user provides an offset equal to `mmio_phys_end - 4`, the check
passes, and will lead to a 4-byte out-of-bounds read.

Fix this by adjusting the boundary check to use sizeof(u64), which
corresponds to the size of the readq() operation.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

This code calls hfs_bnode_put(node) which drops the refcount and then
dreferences "node" on the next line.  It's only safe to use "node"
when we're holding a reference so flip these two lines around.

## AP-CVE-2025-68762 : CVE-2025-68762 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: netpoll: initialize work queue before error checks

Prevent a kernel warning when netconsole setup fails on devices with
IFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL flag. The warning (at kernel/workqueue.c:4242 in
__flush_work) occurs because the cleanup path tries to cancel an
uninitialized work queue.

When __netpoll_setup() encounters a device with IFF_DISABLE_NETPOLL,
it fails early and calls skb_pool_flush() for cleanup. This function
calls cancel_work_sync(&np->refill_wq), but refill_wq hasn't been
initialized yet, triggering the warning.

Move INIT_WORK() to the beginning of __netpoll_setup(), ensuring the
work queue is properly initialized before any potential failure points.
This allows the cleanup path to safely cancel the work queue regardless
of where the setup fails.

In mt7615_mcu_wtbl_sta_add(), an skb sskb is allocated. If the
subsequent call to mt76_connac_mcu_alloc_wtbl_req() fails, the function
returns an error without freeing sskb, leading to a memory leak.

to ensure it is properly released.

## AP-CVE-2025-55204 : CVE-2025-55204 Exploitation
Description: muffon is a cross-platform music streaming client for desktop. Versions prior to 2.3.0 have a one-click Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in. An attacker can exploit this issue by embedding a specially crafted `muffon://` link on any website they control. When a victim visits the site or clicks the link, the browser triggers Muffon’s custom URL handler, causing the application to launch and process the URL. This leads to RCE on the victim's machine without further interaction. Version 2.3.0 patches the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-59156 : CVE-2025-59156 Exploitation
Description: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Prior to version 4.0.0-beta.420.7, a Remote Code Execution (RCE)*vulnerability exists in Coolify's application deployment workflow. This flaw allows a low-privileged member to inject arbitrary Docker Compose directives during project creation or updates. By defining a malicious service that mounts the host filesystem, an attacker can achieve root-level command execution on the host OS, completely bypassing container isolation. Version 4.0.0-beta.420.7 contains a patch for the issue.

Coolify versions prior to and including v4.0.0-beta.420.6 are vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in the project creation workflow. An authenticated user with low privileges (e.g., member role) can create a project with a maliciously crafted name containing embedded JavaScript. When an administrator later attempts to delete the project or its associated resource, the payload automatically executes in the admin’s browser context. Version 4.0.0-beta.420.7 contains a patch for the issue.

Description: Coolify is an open-source and self-hostable tool for managing servers, applications, and databases. Coolify versions prior to and including v4.0.0-beta.420.8 have an information disclosure vulnerability in the `/api/v1/teams/{team_id}/members` and `/api/v1/teams/current/members` API endpoints allows authenticated team members to access a highly sensitive `email_change_code` from other users on the same team. This code is intended for a single-use email change verification and should be kept secret. Its exposure could enable a malicious actor to perform an unauthorized email address change on behalf of the victim. As of time of publication, no known patched versions exist.

## AP-CVE-2025-61781 : CVE-2025-61781 Exploitation
Description: OpenCTI is an open source platform for managing cyber threat intelligence knowledge and observables. Prior to version 6.8.1, the GraphQL mutation "WorkspacePopoverDeletionMutation" allows users to delete workspace-related objects such as dashboards and investigation cases. However, the mutation lacks proper authorization checks to verify ownership of the targeted resources.
An attacker can exploit this by supplying an active UUID of another user. Since the API does not validate whether the requester owns the resource, the mutation executes successfully, resulting in unauthorized deletion of the entire workspace. Version 6.8.1 fixes the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-65922 : CVE-2025-65922 Exploitation
Description: PLANKA 2.0.0 lacks X-Frame-Options and CSP frame-ancestors headers, allowing the application to be embedded within malicious iframes. While this does not lead to unintended modification of projects or tasks, it exposes users to Phishing attacks. Attackers can frame the legitimate Planka application on a malicious site to establish false trust (UI Redressing), potentially tricking users into entering sensitive information or credentials into overlaid fake forms. NOTE: this is disputed by the Supplier because "PLANKA uses SameSite=Strict cookies, preventing authentication in cross-origin contexts. No session can be established. No credential interception or unauthorized actions are possible. Browser Same-Origin Policy prevents the parent page from accessing iframe content. Clickjacking is not applicable on the login page. Any credential capture would require attacker-controlled input and user interaction equivalent to phishing. The security outcome depends entirely on the user's trust in the parent page. An attacker can achieve the same effect with a fully fake login page. Embedding the legitimate page adds no risk, as browsers do not show URL, certificate, or padlock indicators in cross-origin iframes."

## AP-CVE-2025-61916 : CVE-2025-61916 Exploitation
Description: Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform. Versions prior to 2025.1.6, 2025.2.3, and 2025.3.0 are vulnerable to server-side request forgery. The primary impact is allowing users to fetch data from a remote URL. This data can be then injected into spinnaker pipelines via helm or other methods to extract things LIKE idmsv1 authentication data. This also includes calling internal spinnaker API's via a get and similar endpoints. Further, depending upon the artifact in question, auth data may be exposed to arbitrary endpoints (e.g. GitHub auth headers) leading to credentials exposure. To trigger this, a spinnaker installation MUST have two things. The first is an artifact enabled that allows user input. This includes GitHub file artifacts, BitBucket, GitLab, HTTP artifacts and similar artifact providers. JUST enabling the http artifact provider will add a "no-auth" http provider that could be used to extract link local data (e.g. AWS Metadata information). The second is a system that can consume the output of these artifacts. e.g. Rosco helm can use this to fetch values data. K8s account manifests if the API returns JSON can be used to inject that data into the pipeline itself though the pipeline would fail. This vulnerability is fixed in versions 2025.1.6, 2025.2.3, and 2025.3.0. As a workaround, disable HTTP account types that allow user input of a given URL. This is probably not feasible in most cases. Git, Docker and other artifact account types with explicit URL configurations bypass this limitation and should be safe as they limit artifact URL loading. Alternatively, use one of the various vendors which provide OPA policies to restrict pipelines from accessing or saving a pipeline with invalid URLs.

## AP-CVE-2025-65110 : CVE-2025-65110 Exploitation
Description: Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating, saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. Prior to versions 6.1.2 and 5.6.3, applications meeting two conditions are at risk of arbitrary JavaScript code execution, even if "safe mode" expressionInterpreter is used. First, they use `vega` in an application that attaches both `vega` library and a `vega.View` instance similar to the Vega Editor to the global `window`, or has any other satisfactory function gadgets in the global scope. Second, they allow user-defined Vega `JSON` definitions (vs JSON that was is only provided through source code). This vulnerability allows for DOM XSS, potentially stored, potentially reflected, depending on how the library is being used. The vulnerability requires user interaction with the page to trigger. An attacker can exploit this issue by tricking a user into opening a malicious Vega specification. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application’s domain. This can lead to theft of sensitive information such as authentication tokens, manipulation of data displayed to the user, or execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim. This exploit compromises confidentiality and integrity of impacted applications.Patched versions are available in `vega-selections@6.1.2` (requires ESM) for Vega v6 and `vega-selections@5.6.3` (no ESM needed) for Vega v5. As a workaround, do not attach `vega` or `vega.View` instances to global variables or the window as the editor used to do. This is a development-only debugging practice that should not be used in any situation where Vega/Vega-lite definitions can come from untrusted parties.

## AP-CVE-2025-68428 : CVE-2025-68428 Exploitation
Description: jsPDF is a library to generate PDFs in JavaScript. Prior to version 4.0.0, user control of the first argument of the loadFile method in the node.js build allows local file inclusion/path traversal. If given the possibility to pass unsanitized paths to the loadFile method, a user can retrieve file contents of arbitrary files in the local file system the node process is running in. The file contents are included verbatim in the generated PDFs. Other affected methods are `addImage`, `html`, and `addFont`. Only the node.js builds of the library are affected, namely the `dist/jspdf.node.js` and `dist/jspdf.node.min.js` files. The vulnerability has been fixed in jsPDF@4.0.0. This version restricts file system access per default. This semver-major update does not introduce other breaking changes. Some workarounds areavailable. With recent node versions, jsPDF recommends using the `--permission` flag in production. The feature was introduced experimentally in v20.0.0 and is stable since v22.13.0/v23.5.0/v24.0.0. For older node versions, sanitize user-provided paths before passing them to jsPDF.

Description: Craft is a platform for creating digital experiences. In versions 5.0.0-RC1 through 5.8.20 and 4.0.0-RC1 through 4.16.16, the Craft CMS GraphQL `save_<VolumeName>_Asset` mutation is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This vulnerability arises because the `_file` input, specifically its `url` parameter, allows the server to fetch content from arbitrary remote locations without proper validation. Attackers can exploit this by providing internal IP addresses or cloud metadata endpoints as the `url`, forcing the server to make requests to these restricted services. The fetched content is then saved as an asset, which can subsequently be accessed and exfiltrated, leading to potential data exposure and infrastructure compromise. This exploitation requires specific GraphQL permissions for asset management within the targeted volume. Users should update to the patched 5.8.21 and 4.16.17 releases to mitigate the issue.

## AP-CVE-2025-69228 : CVE-2025-69228 Exploitation
Description: AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Versions 3.13.2 and below allow a request to be crafted in such a way that an AIOHTTP server's memory fills up uncontrollably during processing. If an application includes a handler that uses the Request.post() method, an attacker may be able to freeze the server by exhausting the memory. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.

## AP-CVE-2025-69229 : CVE-2025-69229 Exploitation
Description: AIOHTTP is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In versions 3.13.2 and below, handling of chunked messages can result in excessive blocking CPU usage when receiving a large number of chunks. If an application makes use of the request.read() method in an endpoint, it may be possible for an attacker to cause the server to spend a moderate amount of blocking CPU time (e.g. 1 second) while processing the request. This could potentially lead to DoS as the server would be unable to handle other requests during that time. This issue is fixed in version 3.13.3.

## AP-CVE-2025-68954 : CVE-2025-68954 Exploitation
Description: Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Versions 1.11.11 and below do not revoke active SFTP connections when a user is removed from a server instance or has their permissions changes with respect to file access over SFTP. This allows a user that was already connected to SFTP to remain connected and access files even after their permissions are revoked. A user must have been connected to SFTP at the time of their permissions being revoked in order for this vulnerability to be exploited. This issue is fixed in version 1.12.0.

Description: Pterodactyl is a free, open-source game server management panel. Versions 1.11.11 and below allow TOTP to be used multiple times during its validity window. Users with 2FA enabled are prompted to enter a token during sign-in, and afterward it is not sufficiently marked as used in the system. This allows an attacker who intercepts that token to use it in addition to a known username/password during the 60-second token validity window. The attacker must have intercepted a valid 2FA token (for example, during a screen share). This issue is fixed in version 1.12.0.

Description: fast-filesystem-mcp version 3.4.0 contains a critical path traversal vulnerability in its file operation tools including fast_read_file. This vulnerability arises from improper path validation that fails to resolve symbolic links to their actual physical paths. The safePath and isPathAllowed functions use path.resolve() which does not handle symlinks, allowing attackers to bypass directory access restrictions by creating symlinks within allowed directories that point to restricted system paths. When these symlinks are accessed through valid path references, the validation checks are circumvented, enabling access to unauthorized files.

## AP-CVE-2025-67366 : CVE-2025-67366 Exploitation
Description: @sylphxltd/filesystem-mcp v0.5.8 is an MCP server that provides file content reading functionality. Version 0.5.8 of filesystem-mcp contains a critical path traversal vulnerability in its "read_content" tool. This vulnerability arises from improper symlink handling in the path validation mechanism: the resolvePath function checks path validity before resolving symlinks, while fs.readFile resolves symlinks automatically during file access. This allows attackers to bypass directory restrictions by leveraging symlinks within the allowed directory that point to external files, enabling unauthorized access to files outside the intended operational scope.

## AP-CVE-2025-66560 : CVE-2025-66560 Exploitation
Description: Quarkus is a Cloud Native, (Linux) Container First framework for writing Java applications. Prior to versions 3.31.0, 3.27.2, and 3.20.5, a vulnerability exists in the HTTP layer of Quarkus REST related to response handling. When a response is being written, the framework waits for previously written response chunks to be fully transmitted before proceeding. If the client connection is dropped during this waiting period, the associated worker thread is never released and becomes permanently blocked. Under sustained or repeated occurrences, this can exhaust the available worker threads, leading to degraded performance, or complete unavailability of the application. This issue has been patched in versions 3.31.0, 3.27.2, and 3.20.5. A workaround involves implementing a health check that monitors the status and saturation of the worker thread pool to detect abnormal thread retention early.

## AP-CVE-2025-12776 : CVE-2025-12776 Exploitation
Description: The Report Builder component of the application stores user input directly in a web page and displays it to other users, which raised concerns about a possible Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. Proper management of this functionality helps ensure a secure and seamless user experience.  Although the user input is not validated in the report creation, these scripts are not executed when the report is run by end users. The script is executed when the report is modified through the report builder by a user with edit permissions. 




The Report Builder is part of the WebConsole.  The WebConsole package is currently end of life, and is no longer maintained. We strongly recommend against installing or using it in any production environment. However, if you choose to install it, for example, to access functionality like the Report Builder, it must be deployed within a fully isolated network that has no access to sensitive data or internet connectivity. This is a critical security precaution, as the retired package may contain unpatched vulnerabilities and is no longer supported with updates or fixes.

## AP-CVE-2026-21441 : CVE-2026-21441 Exploitation
Description: urllib3 is an HTTP client library for Python. urllib3's streaming API is designed for the efficient handling of large HTTP responses by reading the content in chunks, rather than loading the entire response body into memory at once. urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). When using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial content consumption. Starting in version 1.22 and prior to version 2.6.3, for HTTP redirect responses, the library would read the entire response body to drain the connection and decompress the content unnecessarily. This decompression occurred even before any read methods were called, and configured read limits did not restrict the amount of decompressed data. As a result, there was no safeguard against decompression bombs. A malicious server could exploit this to trigger excessive resource consumption on the client. Applications and libraries are affected when they stream content from untrusted sources by setting `preload_content=False` when they do not disable redirects. Users should upgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.3, in which the library does not decode content of redirect responses when `preload_content=False`. If upgrading is not immediately possible, disable redirects by setting `redirect=False` for requests to untrusted source.

## AP-CVE-2025-15346 : CVE-2025-15346 Exploitation
Description: A vulnerability in the handling of verify_mode = CERT_REQUIRED in the wolfssl Python package (wolfssl-py) causes client certificate requirements to not be fully enforced. 

Because the WOLFSSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT flag was not included, the behavior effectively matched CERT_OPTIONAL: a peer certificate was verified if presented, but connections were incorrectly authenticated when no client certificate was provided. 

This results in improper authentication, allowing attackers to bypass mutual TLS (mTLS) client authentication by omitting a client certificate during the TLS handshake. 

The issue affects versions up to and including 5.8.2.

## AP-CVE-2026-21695 : CVE-2026-21695 Exploitation
Description: Titra is open source project time tracking software. In versions 0.99.49 and below, an API has a Mass Assignment vulnerability which allows authenticated users to inject arbitrary fields into time entries, bypassing business logic controls via the customfields parameter. The affected endpoint uses the JavaScript spread operator (...customfields) to merge user-controlled input directly into the database document. While customfields is validated as an Object type, there is no validation of which keys are permitted inside that object. This allows attackers to overwrite protected fields such as userId, hours, and state. The issue is fixed in version 0.99.50.

## AP-CVE-2026-21869 : CVE-2026-21869 Exploitation
Description: llama.cpp is an inference of several LLM models in C/C++. In commits 55d4206c8 and prior, the n_discard parameter is parsed directly from JSON input in the llama.cpp server's completion endpoints without validation to ensure it's non-negative. When a negative value is supplied and the context fills up, llama_memory_seq_rm/add receives a reversed range and negative offset, causing out-of-bounds memory writes in the token evaluation loop. This deterministic memory corruption can crash the process or enable remote code execution (RCE). There is no fix at the time of publication.

Description: ClipBucket v5 is an open source video sharing platform. Versions 5.5.2-#187 and below allow an attacker to perform Blind SQL Injection through the add comment section within a channel. When adding a comment within a channel, there is a POST request to the /actions/ajax.php endpoint. The obj_id parameter within the POST request to /actions/ajax.php is then used within the user_exists function of the upload/includes/classes/user.class. php file as the $id parameter. It is then used within the count function of the upload/includes/classes/db.class. php file. The $id parameter is concatenated into the query without validation or sanitization, and a user-supplied input like 1' or 1=1-- - can be used to trigger the injection. This issue does not have a fix at the time of publication.

## AP-CVE-2026-21868 : CVE-2026-21868 Exploitation
Description: Flag Forge is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform. Versions 2.3.2 and below have a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the user profile API endpoint (/api/user/[username]). The application constructs a regular expression dynamically using unescaped user input (the username parameter). An attacker can exploit this by sending a specially crafted username containing regex meta-characters (e.g., deeply nested groups or quantifiers), causing the MongoDB regex engine to consume excessive CPU resources. This can lead to Denial of Service for other users. The issue is fixed in version 2.3.3. To workaround this issue, implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) rule to block requests containing regex meta-characters in the URL path.

## AP-CVE-2026-21883 : CVE-2026-21883 Exploitation
Description: Bokeh is an interactive visualization library written in Python. In versions 3.8.1 and below, if a server is configured with an allowlist (e.g., dashboard.corp), an attacker can register a domain like dashboard.corp.attacker.com (or use a subdomain if applicable) and lure a victim to visit it. The malicious site can then initiate a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable Bokeh server. Since the Origin header (e.g., http://dashboard.corp.attacker.com/) matches the allowlist according to the flawed logic, the connection is accepted. Once connected, the attacker can interact with the Bokeh server on behalf of the victim, potentially accessing sensitive data, or modifying visualizations. This issue is fixed in version 3.8.2.

## AP-CVE-2026-21871 : CVE-2026-21871 Exploitation
Description: NiceGUI is a Python-based UI framework. From versions 2.13.0 to 3.4.1, there is a XSS risk in NiceGUI when developers pass attacker-controlled strings into ui.navigate.history.push() or ui.navigate.history.replace(). These helpers are documented as History API wrappers for updating the browser URL without page reload. However, if the URL argument is embedded into generated JavaScript without proper escaping, a crafted payload can break out of the intended string context and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser. Applications that do not pass untrusted input into ui.navigate.history.push/replace are not affected. This issue has been patched in version 3.5.0.

## AP-CVE-2026-21894 : CVE-2026-21894 Exploitation
Description: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. In versions from 0.150.0 to before 2.2.2, an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Stripe Trigger node allows unauthenticated parties to trigger workflows by sending forged Stripe webhook events. The Stripe Trigger creates and stores a Stripe webhook signing secret when registering the webhook endpoint, but incoming webhook requests were not verified against this secret. As a result, any HTTP client that knows the webhook URL could send a POST request containing a matching event type, causing the workflow to execute as if a legitimate Stripe event had been received. This issue affects n8n users who have active workflows using the Stripe Trigger node. An attacker could potentially fake payment or subscription events and influence downstream workflow behavior. The practical risk is reduced by the fact that the webhook URL contains a high-entropy UUID; however, authenticated n8n users with access to the workflow can view this webhook ID. This issue has been patched in version 2.2.2. A temporary workaround for this issue involves users deactivating affected workflows or restricting access to workflows containing Stripe Trigger nodes to trusted users only.

## AP-CVE-2026-21876 : CVE-2026-21876 Exploitation
Description: The OWASP core rule set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with compatible web application firewalls. Prior to versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8, the current rule 922110 has a bug when processing multipart requests with multiple parts. When the first rule in a chain iterates over a collection (like `MULTIPART_PART_HEADERS`), the capture variables (`TX:0`, `TX:1`) get overwritten with each iteration. Only the last captured value is available to the chained rule, which means malicious charsets in earlier parts can be missed if a later part has a legitimate charset. Versions 4.22.0 and 3.3.8 patch the issue.

## AP-CVE-2026-22028 : CVE-2026-22028 Exploitation
Description: Preact, a lightweight web development framework, JSON serialization protection to prevent Virtual DOM elements from being constructed from arbitrary JSON. A regression introduced in Preact 10.26.5 caused this protection to be softened. In applications where values from JSON payloads are assumed to be strings and passed unmodified to Preact as children, a specially-crafted JSON payload could be constructed that would be incorrectly treated as a valid VNode. When this chain of failures occurs it can result in HTML injection, which can allow arbitrary script execution if not mitigated by CSP or other means. Applications using affected Preact versions are vulnerable if they meet all of the following conditions: first, pass unmodified, unsanitized values from user-modifiable data sources (APIs, databases, local storage, etc.) directly into the render tree; second assume these values are strings but the data source could return actual JavaScript objects instead of JSON strings; and third, the data source either fails to perform type sanitization AND blindly stores/returns raw objects interchangeably with strings, OR is compromised (e.g., poisoned local storage, filesystem, or database). Versions 10.26.10, 10.27.3, and 10.28.2 patch the issue. The patch versions restore the previous strict equality checks that prevent JSON-parsed objects from being treated as valid VNodes. Other mitigations are available for those who cannot immediately upgrade. Validate input types, cast or validate network data, sanitize external data, and use Content Security Policy (CSP).

## AP-CVE-2026-22032 : CVE-2026-22032 Exploitation
Description: Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL database content. Prior to version 11.14.0, an open redirect vulnerability exists in the Directus SAML authentication callback endpoint. During SAML authentication, the `RelayState` parameter is intended to preserve the user's original destination. However, while the login initiation flow validates redirect targets against allowed domains, this validation is not applied to the callback endpoint. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious authentication request that redirects users to an arbitrary external URL upon completion. The vulnerability is present in both the success and error handling paths of the callback. This vulnerability can be exploited without authentication. Version 11.14.0 contains a patch.

## AP-CVE-2026-22042 : CVE-2026-22042 Exploitation
Description: RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. Prior to version 1.0.0-alpha.79, he `ImportIam` admin API validates permissions using `ExportIAMAction` instead of `ImportIAMAction`, allowing a principal with export-only IAM permissions to perform import operations. Since importing IAM data performs privileged write actions (creating/updating users, groups, policies, and service accounts), this can lead to unauthorized IAM modification and privilege escalation. Version 1.0.0-alpha.79 fixes the issue.

## AP-CVE-2026-22245 : CVE-2026-22245 Exploitation
Description: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. By nature, Mastodon performs a lot of outbound requests to user-provided domains. Mastodon, however, has some protection mechanism to disallow requests to local IP addresses (unless specified in `ALLOWED_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES`) to avoid the "confused deputy" problem. The list of disallowed IP address ranges was lacking some IP address ranges that can be used to reach local IP addresses. An attacker can use an IP address in the affected ranges to make Mastodon perform HTTP requests against loopback or local network hosts, potentially allowing access to otherwise private resources and services. This is fixed in Mastodon v4.5.4, v4.4.11, v4.3.17 and v4.2.29.

Description: Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub. Mastodon 4.3 added notifications of severed relationships, allowing end-users to inspect the relationships they lost as the result of a moderation action. The code allowing users to download lists of severed relationships for a particular event fails to check the owner of the list before returning the lost relationships. Any registered local user can access the list of lost followers and followed users caused by any severance event, and go through all severance events this way. The leaked information does not include the name of the account which has lost follows and followers. This has been fixed in Mastodon v4.3.17, v4.4.11 and v4.5.4.

In version 1.6.5 and prior, cache-backed state/request-token storage is not tied to the initiating user session, so CSRF is possible for any attacker that has a valid state (easily obtainable via an attacker-initiated authentication flow). When a cache is supplied to the OAuth client registry, FrameworkIntegration.set_state_data writes the entire state blob under _state_{app}_{state}, and get_state_data ignores the caller’s session altogether. This issue has been patched in version 1.6.6.

Description: The ECDSA implementation of the Elliptic package generates incorrect signatures if an interim value of 'k' (as computed based on step 3.2 of  RFC 6979 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6979 ) has leading zeros and is susceptible to cryptanalysis, which can lead to secret key exposure. This happens, because the byte-length of 'k' is incorrectly computed, resulting in its getting truncated during the computation. Legitimate transactions or communications will be broken as a result. Furthermore, due to the nature of the fault, attackers could–under certain conditions–derive the secret key, if they could get their hands on both a faulty signature generated by a vulnerable version of Elliptic and a correct signature for the same inputs.

This issue affects all known versions of Elliptic (at the time of writing, versions less than or equal to 6.6.1).

## AP-CVE-2026-22588 : CVE-2026-22588 Exploitation
Description: Spree is an open source e-commerce solution built with Ruby on Rails. Prior to versions 4.10.2, 5.0.7, 5.1.9, and 5.2.5, an Authenticated Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability was identified that allows an authenticated user to retrieve other users’ address information by modifying an existing order. By editing an order they legitimately own and manipulating address identifiers in the request, the backend server accepts and processes references to addresses belonging to other users, subsequently associating those addresses with the attacker’s order and returning them in the response. This issue has been patched in versions 4.10.2, 5.0.7, 5.1.9, and 5.2.5.

## AP-CVE-2025-62487 : CVE-2025-62487 Exploitation
Description: ### Details
On October 1, 2025, Palantir discovered that images uploaded through the Dossier front-end app were not being marked correctly with the proper security levels. The regression was traced back to a change in May 2025, which was meant to allow file uploads to be shared among different artifacts (e.g. other dossiers and presentations).

On deployments configured with CBAC, the front-end would present a security picker dialog to set the security level on the uploads, thereby mitigating the issue.

On deployments without a CBAC configuration, no security picker dialog appears, leading to a security level of CUSTOM with no markings or datasets selected. The resulting markings and groups for the file uploads thus will be only those added by the “Default authorization rules” defined in the Auth Chooser configuration. On most environments, it is expected that the “Default authorization rules" only add the Everyone group.

## AP-CVE-2026-21897 : CVE-2026-21897 Exploitation
Description: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, the Crypto_Config_Add_Gvcid_Managed_Parameters function only checks whether gvcid_counter > GVCID_MAN_PARAM_SIZE. As a result, it allows up to the 251st entry, which causes a write past the end of the array, overwriting gvcid_counter located immediately after gvcid_managed_parameters_array[250]. This leads to an out-of-bounds write, and the overwritten gvcid_counter may become an arbitrary value, potentially affecting the parameter lookup/registration logic that relies on it. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.

Description: CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. Prior to version 1.4.3, CryptoLib’s KMC crypto service integration is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow when decoding Base64-encoded ciphertext/cleartext fields returned by the KMC service. The decode destination buffer is sized using an expected output length (len_data_out), but the Base64 decoder writes output based on the actual Base64 input length and does not enforce any destination size limit. An oversized Base64 string in the KMC JSON response can cause out-of-bounds writes on the heap, resulting in process crash and potentially code execution under certain conditions. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.3.

## AP-CVE-2026-22600 : CVE-2026-22600 Exploitation
Description: OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. A Local File Read (LFR) vulnerability exists in the work package PDF export functionality of OpenProject prior to version 16.6.4. By uploading a specially crafted SVG file (disguised as a PNG) as a work package attachment, an attacker can exploit the backend image processing engine (ImageMagick). When the work package is exported to PDF, the backend attempts to resize the image, triggering the ImageMagick text: coder. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary local files that the application user has permissions to access (e.g., /etc/passwd, all project configuration files, private project data, etc.). The attack requires permissions to upload attachments to a container that can be exported to PDF, such as a work package. The issue has been patched in version 16.6.4. Those who are unable to upgrade may apply the patch manually.

## AP-CVE-2026-22602 : CVE-2026-22602 Exploitation
Description: OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. Prior to version 16.6.2, a low‑privileged logged-in user can view the full names of other users. Since user IDs are assigned sequentially and predictably (e.g., 1 to 1000), an attacker can extract a complete list of all users’ full names by iterating through these URLs. The same behavior can also be reproduced via the OpenProject API, allowing automated retrieval of full names through the API as well. This issue has been patched in version 16.6.2. Those who are unable to upgrade may apply the patch manually.

## AP-CVE-2026-22603 : CVE-2026-22603 Exploitation
Description: OpenProject is an open-source, web-based project management software. Prior to version 16.6.2, OpenProject’s unauthenticated password-change endpoint (/account/change_password) was not protected by the same brute-force safeguards that apply to the normal login form. In affected versions, an attacker who can guess or enumerate user IDs can send unlimited password-change requests for a given account without triggering lockout or other rate-limiting controls. This allows automated password-guessing (e.g., with wordlists of common passwords) against valid accounts. Successful guessing results in full account compromise for the targeted user and, depending on that user’s role, can lead to further privilege escalation inside the application. This issue has been patched in version 16.6.2. Those who are unable to upgrade may apply the patch manually.

In @react-router/node versions 7.0.0 through 7.9.3, @remix-run/deno prior to version 2.17.2, and @remix-run/node prior to version 2.17.2, if createFileSessionStorage() is being used from @react-router/node (or @remix-run/node/@remix-run/deno in Remix v2) with an unsigned cookie, it is possible for an attacker to cause the session to try to read/write from a location outside the specified session file directory. The success of the attack would depend on the permissions of the web server process to access those files. Read files cannot be returned directly to the attacker. Session file reads would only succeed if the file matched the expected session file format. If the file matched the session file format, the data would be populated into the server side session but not directly returned to the attacker unless the application logic returned specific session information. This issue has been patched in @react-router/node version 7.9.4, @remix-run/deno version 2.17.2, and @remix-run/node version 2.17.2.

Description: DevToys is a desktop app for developers. In versions from 2.0.0.0 to before 2.0.9.0, a path traversal vulnerability exists in the DevToys extension installation mechanism. When processing extension packages (NUPKG archives), DevToys does not sufficiently validate file paths contained within the archive. A malicious extension package could include crafted file entries such as ../../…/target-file, causing the extraction process to write files outside the intended extensions directory. This flaw enables an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the user’s system with the privileges of the DevToys process. Depending on the environment, this may lead to code execution, configuration tampering, or corruption of application or system files. This issue has been patched in version 2.0.9.0.

## AP-CVE-2026-22693 : CVE-2026-22693 Exploitation
Description: HarfBuzz is a text shaping engine. Prior to version 12.3.0, a null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the SubtableUnicodesCache::create function located in src/hb-ot-cmap-table.hh. The function fails to check if hb_malloc returns NULL before using placement new to construct an object at the returned pointer address. When hb_malloc fails to allocate memory (which can occur in low-memory conditions or when using custom allocators that simulate allocation failures), it returns NULL. The code then attempts to call the constructor on this null pointer using placement new syntax, resulting in undefined behavior and a Segmentation Fault. This issue has been patched in version 12.3.0.

## AP-CVE-2026-22698 : CVE-2026-22698 Exploitation
Description: RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points, and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a  critical vulnerability exists in the SM2 Public Key Encryption (PKE) implementation where the ephemeral nonce k is generated with severely reduced entropy. A unit mismatch error causes the nonce generation function to request only 32 bits of randomness instead of the expected 256 bits. This reduces the security of the encryption from a 128-bit level to a trivial 16-bit level, allowing a practical attack to recover the nonce k and decrypt any ciphertext given only the public key and ciphertext. This issue has been patched via commit e4f7778.

Description: RustCrypto: Elliptic Curves is general purpose Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) support, including types and traits for representing various elliptic curve forms, scalars, points, and public/secret keys composed thereof. In versions 0.14.0-pre.0 and 0.14.0-rc.0, a denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the SM2 PKE decryption path where an invalid elliptic-curve point (C1) is decoded and the resulting value is unwrapped without checking. Specifically, AffinePoint::from_encoded_point(&encoded_c1) may return a None/CtOption::None when the supplied coordinates are syntactically valid but do not lie on the SM2 curve. The calling code previously used .unwrap(), causing a panic when presented with such input. This issue has been patched via commit 085b7be.

## AP-CVE-2026-22701 : CVE-2026-22701 Exploitation
Description: filelock is a platform-independent file lock for Python. Prior to version 3.20.3, a TOCTOU race condition vulnerability exists in the SoftFileLock implementation of the filelock package. An attacker with local filesystem access and permission to create symlinks can exploit a race condition between the permission validation and file creation to cause lock operations to fail or behave unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs in the _acquire() method between raise_on_not_writable_file() (permission check) and os.open() (file creation). During this race window, an attacker can create a symlink at the lock file path, potentially causing the lock to operate on an unintended target file or leading to denial of service. This issue has been patched in version 3.20.3.

## AP-CVE-2026-22703 : CVE-2026-22703 Exploitation
Description: Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to versions 2.6.2 and 3.0.4, Cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully verify an artifact even if the embedded Rekor entry does not reference the artifact's digest, signature or public key. When verifying a Rekor entry, Cosign verifies the Rekor entry signature, and also compares the artifact's digest, the user's public key from either a Fulcio certificate or provided by the user, and the artifact signature to the Rekor entry contents. Without these comparisons, Cosign would accept any response from Rekor as valid. A malicious actor that has compromised a user's identity or signing key could construct a valid Cosign bundle by including any arbitrary Rekor entry, thus preventing the user from being able to audit the signing event. This issue has been patched in versions 2.6.2 and 3.0.4.

Description: MindsDB is a platform for building artificial intelligence from enterprise data. Prior to version 25.11.1, an unauthenticated path traversal in the file upload API lets any caller read arbitrary files from the server filesystem and move them into MindsDB’s storage, exposing sensitive data. The PUT handler in file.py directly joins user-controlled data into a filesystem path when the request body is JSON and source_type is not "url". Only multipart uploads and URL-sourced uploads receive sanitization; JSON uploads lack any call to clear_filename or equivalent checks. This vulnerability is fixed in 25.11.1.

## AP-CVE-2025-68622 : CVE-2025-68622 Exploitation
Description: Espressif ESP-IDF USB Host UVC Class Driver allows video streaming from USB cameras. Prior to 2.4.0, a vulnerability in the esp-usb UVC host implementation allows a malicious USB Video Class (UVC) device to trigger a stack buffer overflow during configuration-descriptor parsing. When UVC configuration-descriptor printing is enabled, the host prints detailed descriptor information provided by the connected USB device. A specially crafted UVC descriptor may advertise an excessively large length. Because this value is not validated before being copied into a fixed-size stack buffer, an attacker can overflow the buffer and corrupt memory. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.4.0.

## AP-CVE-2026-22033 : CVE-2026-22033 Exploitation
Description: Label Studio is a multi-type data labeling and annotation tool. In 1.22.0 and earlier, a persistent stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the custom_hotkeys functionality of the application. An authenticated attacker (or one who can trick a user/administrator into updating their custom_hotkeys) can inject JavaScript code that executes in other users’ browsers when those users load any page using the templates/base.html template. Because the application exposes an API token endpoint (/api/current-user/token) to the browser and lacks robust CSRF protection on some API endpoints, the injected script may fetch the victim’s API token or call token reset endpoints — enabling full account takeover and unauthorized API access.

## AP-CVE-2026-22200 : CVE-2026-22200 Exploitation
Description: Enhancesoft osTicket versions up to and including 1.18.2 contain an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the ticket PDF export functionality. A remote attacker can submit a ticket containing crafted rich-text HTML that includes PHP filter expressions which are insufficiently sanitized before being processed by the mPDF PDF generator during export. When the attacker exports the ticket to PDF, the generated PDF can embed the contents of attacker-selected files from the server filesystem as bitmap images, allowing disclosure of sensitive local files in the context of the osTicket application user. This issue is exploitable in default configurations where guests may create tickets and access ticket status, or where self-registration is enabled.

## AP-CVE-2026-22799 : CVE-2026-22799 Exploitation
Description: Emlog is an open source website building system. emlog v2.6.1 and earlier exposes a REST API endpoint (/index.php?rest-api=upload) for media file uploads. The endpoint fails to implement proper validation of file types, extensions, and content, allowing authenticated attackers (with a valid API key or admin session cookie) to upload arbitrary files (including malicious PHP scripts) to the server. An attacker can obtain the API key either by gaining administrator access to enable the REST API setting, or via information disclosure vulnerabilities in the application. Once uploaded, the malicious PHP file can be executed to gain remote code execution (RCE) on the target server, leading to full server compromise.

Description: LlamaIndex (run-llama/llama_index) versions up to and including 0.12.2 contain an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in the VannaPack VannaQueryEngine implementation. The custom_query() logic generates SQL statements from a user-supplied prompt and executes them via vn.run_sql() without enforcing query execution limits In downstream deployments where untrusted users can supply prompts, an attacker can trigger expensive or unbounded SQL operations that exhaust CPU or memory resources, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The vulnerable execution path occurs in llama_index/packs/vanna/base.py within custom_query().

## AP-CVE-2025-15514 : CVE-2025-15514 Exploitation
Description: Ollama 0.11.5-rc0 through current version 0.13.5 contain a null pointer dereference vulnerability in the multi-modal model image processing functionality. When processing base64-encoded image data via the /api/chat endpoint, the application fails to validate that the decoded data represents valid media before passing it to the mtmd_helper_bitmap_init_from_buf function. This function can return NULL for malformed input, but the code does not check this return value before dereferencing the pointer in subsequent operations. A remote attacker can exploit this by sending specially crafted base64 image data that decodes to invalid media, causing a segmentation fault and crashing the runner process. This results in a denial of service condition where the model becomes unavailable to all users until the service is restarted.

Description: RIOT OS versions up to and including 2026.01-devel-317 contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the tapslip6 utility. The vulnerability is caused by unsafe string concatenation in the devopen() function, which constructs a device path using unbounded user-controlled input. The utility uses strcpy() and strcat() to concatenate the fixed prefix '/dev/' with a user-supplied device name provided via the -s command-line option without bounds checking. This allows an attacker to supply an excessively long device name and overflow a fixed-size stack buffer, leading to process crashes and memory corruption.

Description: RIOT OS versions up to and including 2026.01-devel-317 contain a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the ethos utility due to missing bounds checking when processing incoming serial frame data. The vulnerability occurs in the _handle_char() function, where incoming frame bytes are appended to a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying that the current write index remains within bounds. An attacker capable of sending crafted serial or TCP-framed input can cause the current write index to exceed the buffer size, resulting in a write past the end of the stack buffer. This condition leads to memory corruption and application crash.

Description: PILOS (Platform for Interactive Live-Online Seminars) is a frontend for BigBlueButton. Prior to 4.10.0, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in an administrative API endpoint responsible for terminating all active video conferences on a single server. The affected endpoint performs a destructive action but is exposed via an HTTP GET request. Although proper authorization checks are enforced and the endpoint cannot be triggered cross-site, the use of GET allows the action to be implicitly invoked through same-site content (e.g. embedded resources rendered within the application). As a result, an authenticated administrator who views crafted content within the application may unknowingly trigger the endpoint, causing all active video conferences on the server to be terminated without explicit intent or confirmation. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.10.0.

Description: A CORS misconfiguration in Eramba Community and Enterprise Editions v3.26.0 allows an attacker-controlled Origin header to be reflected in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response along with Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true. This permits malicious third-party websites to perform authenticated cross-origin requests against the Eramba API, including endpoints like /system-api/login and /system-api/user/me. The response includes sensitive user session data (ID, name, email, access groups), which is accessible to the attacker's JavaScript. This flaw enables full session hijack and data exfiltration without user interaction. Eramba versions 3.23.3 and earlier were tested and appear unaffected. The vulnerability is present in default installations, requiring no custom configuration.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfsplus: Verify inode mode when loading from disk

syzbot is reporting that S_IFMT bits of inode->i_mode can become bogus when
the S_IFMT bits of the 16bits "mode" field loaded from disk are corrupted.

According to [1], the permissions field was treated as reserved in Mac OS
8 and 9. According to [2], the reserved field was explicitly initialized
with 0, and that field must remain 0 as long as reserved. Therefore, when
the "mode" field is not 0 (i.e. no longer reserved), the file must be
S_IFDIR if dir == 1, and the file must be one of S_IFREG/S_IFLNK/S_IFCHR/
S_IFBLK/S_IFIFO/S_IFSOCK if dir == 0.

## AP-CVE-2025-68768 : CVE-2025-68768 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

inet: frags: flush pending skbs in fqdir_pre_exit()

We have been seeing occasional deadlocks on pernet_ops_rwsem since
September in NIPA. The stuck task was usually modprobe (often loading
a driver like ipvlan), trying to take the lock as a Writer.
lockdep does not track readers for rwsems so the read wasn't obvious
from the reports.

On closer inspection the Reader holding the lock was conntrack looping
forever in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list(). Based on past experience
with occasional NIPA crashes I looked thru the tests which run before
the crash and noticed that the crash follows ip_defrag.sh. An immediate
red flag. Scouring thru (de)fragmentation queues reveals skbs sitting
around, holding conntrack references.

The problem is that since conntrack depends on nf_defrag_ipv6,
nf_defrag_ipv6 will load first. Since nf_defrag_ipv6 loads first its
netns exit hooks run _after_ conntrack's netns exit hook.

Flush all fragment queue SKBs during fqdir_pre_exit() to release
conntrack references before conntrack cleanup runs. Also flush
the queues in timer expiry handlers when they discover fqdir->dead
is set, in case packet sneaks in while we're running the pre_exit
flush.

The commit under Fixes is not exactly the culprit, but I think
previously the timer firing would eventually unblock the spinning
conntrack.

## AP-CVE-2025-68770 : CVE-2025-68770 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Fix XDP_TX path

For XDP_TX action in bnxt_rx_xdp(), clearing of the event flags is not
correct.  __bnxt_poll_work() -> bnxt_rx_pkt() -> bnxt_rx_xdp() may be
looping within NAPI and some event flags may be set in earlier
iterations.  In particular, if BNXT_TX_EVENT is set earlier indicating
some XDP_TX packets are ready and pending, it will be cleared if it is
XDP_TX action again.  Normally, we will set BNXT_TX_EVENT again when we
successfully call __bnxt_xmit_xdp().  But if the TX ring has no more
room, the flag will not be set.  This will cause the TX producer to be
ahead but the driver will not hit the TX doorbell.

For multi-buf XDP_TX, there is no need to clear the event flags and set
BNXT_AGG_EVENT.  The BNXT_AGG_EVENT flag should have been set earlier in
bnxt_rx_pkt().

The visible symptom of this is that the RX ring associated with the
TX XDP ring will eventually become empty and all packets will be dropped.
Because this condition will cause the driver to not refill the RX ring
seeing that the TX ring has forever pending XDP_TX packets.

The fix is to only clear BNXT_RX_EVENT when we have successfully
called __bnxt_xmit_xdp().

## AP-CVE-2025-68771 : CVE-2025-68771 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain

syzbot reported a kernel BUG in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() because the
`cl_next_free_rec` field of the allocation chain list (next free slot in
the chain list) is 0, triggring the BUG_ON(!cl->cl_next_free_rec)
condition in ocfs2_find_victim_chain() and panicking the kernel.

To fix this, an if condition is introduced in ocfs2_claim_suballoc_bits(),
just before calling ocfs2_find_victim_chain(), the code block in it being
executed when either of the following conditions is true:

1. `cl_next_free_rec` is equal to 0, indicating that there are no free
chains in the allocation chain list
2. `cl_next_free_rec` is greater than `cl_count` (the total number of
chains in the allocation chain list)

Either of them being true is indicative of the fact that there are no
chains left for usage.

This is addressed using ocfs2_error(), which prints
the error log for debugging purposes, rather than panicking the kernel.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: fsl-cpm: Check length parity before switching to 16 bit mode

Commit fc96ec826bce ("spi: fsl-cpm: Use 16 bit mode for large transfers
with even size") failed to make sure that the size is really even
before switching to 16 bit mode. Until recently the problem went
unnoticed because kernfs uses a pre-allocated bounce buffer of size
PAGE_SIZE for reading EEPROM.

But commit 8ad6249c51d0 ("eeprom: at25: convert to spi-mem API")
introduced an additional dynamically allocated bounce buffer whose size
is exactly the size of the transfer, leading to a buffer overrun in
the fsl-cpm driver when that size is odd.

Add the missing length parity verification and remain in 8 bit mode
when the length is not even.

## AP-CVE-2025-68774 : CVE-2025-68774 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hfsplus: fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create

When sync() and link() are called concurrently, both threads may
enter hfs_bnode_find() without finding the node in the hash table
and proceed to create it.

Thread A:
  hfsplus_write_inode()
    -> hfsplus_write_system_inode()
      -> hfs_btree_write()
        -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)
          -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)

Thread B:
  hfsplus_create_cat()
    -> hfs_brec_insert()
      -> hfs_bnode_split()
        -> hfs_bmap_alloc()
          -> hfs_bnode_find(tree, 0)
            -> __hfs_bnode_create(tree, 0)

In this case, thread A creates the bnode, sets refcnt=1, and hashes it.
Thread B also tries to create the same bnode, notices it has already
been inserted, drops its own instance, and uses the hashed one without
getting the node.

```

	node2 = hfs_bnode_findhash(tree, cnid);
	if (!node2) {                                 <- Thread A
		hash = hfs_bnode_hash(cnid);
		node->next_hash = tree->node_hash[hash];
		tree->node_hash[hash] = node;
		tree->node_hash_cnt++;
	} else {                                      <- Thread B
		spin_unlock(&tree->hash_lock);
		kfree(node);
		wait_event(node2->lock_wq,
			!test_bit(HFS_BNODE_NEW, &node2->flags));
		return node2;
	}
```

However, hfs_bnode_find() requires each call to take a reference.
Here both threads end up setting refcnt=1. When they later put the node,
this triggers:

BUG_ON(!atomic_read(&node->refcnt))

In this scenario, Thread B in fact finds the node in the hash table
rather than creating a new one, and thus must take a reference.

Fix this by calling hfs_bnode_get() when reusing a bnode newly created by
another thread to ensure the refcount is updated correctly.

A similar bug was fixed in HFS long ago in commit
a9dc087fd3c4 ("fix missing hfs_bnode_get() in __hfs_bnode_create")
but the same issue remained in HFS+ until now.

## AP-CVE-2025-68775 : CVE-2025-68775 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/handshake: duplicate handshake cancellations leak socket

When a handshake request is cancelled it is removed from the
handshake_net->hn_requests list, but it is still present in the
handshake_rhashtbl until it is destroyed.

If a second cancellation request arrives for the same handshake request,
then remove_pending() will return false... and assuming
HANDSHAKE_F_REQ_COMPLETED isn't set in req->hr_flags, we'll continue
processing through the out_true label, where we put another reference on
the sock and a refcount underflow occurs.

This can happen for example if a handshake times out - particularly if
the SUNRPC client sends the AUTH_TLS probe to the server but doesn't
follow it up with the ClientHello due to a problem with tlshd.  When the
timeout is hit on the server, the server will send a FIN, which triggers
a cancellation request via xs_reset_transport().  When the timeout is
hit on the client, another cancellation request happens via
xs_tls_handshake_sync().

Add a test_and_set_bit(HANDSHAKE_F_REQ_COMPLETED) in the pending cancel
path so duplicate cancels can be detected.

## AP-CVE-2025-68778 : CVE-2025-68778 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: don't log conflicting inode if it's a dir moved in the current transaction

We can't log a conflicting inode if it's a directory and it was moved
from one parent directory to another parent directory in the current
transaction, as this can result an attempt to have a directory with
two hard links during log replay, one for the old parent directory and
another for the new parent directory.

The following scenario triggers that issue:

1) We have directories "dir1" and "dir2" created in a past transaction.
   Directory "dir1" has inode A as its parent directory;

2) We move "dir1" to some other directory;

3) We create a file with the name "dir1" in directory inode A;

4) We fsync the new file. This results in logging the inode of the new file
   and the inode for the directory "dir1" that was previously moved in the
   current transaction. So the log tree has the INODE_REF item for the
   new location of "dir1";

5) We move the new file to some other directory. This results in updating
   the log tree to included the new INODE_REF for the new location of the
   file and removes the INODE_REF for the old location. This happens
   during the rename when we call btrfs_log_new_name();

6) We fsync the file, and that persists the log tree changes done in the
   previous step (btrfs_log_new_name() only updates the log tree in
   memory);

7) We have a power failure;

8) Next time the fs is mounted, log replay happens and when processing
   the inode for directory "dir1" we find a new INODE_REF and add that
   link, but we don't remove the old link of the inode since we have
   not logged the old parent directory of the directory inode "dir1".

As a result after log replay finishes when we trigger writeback of the
subvolume tree's extent buffers, the tree check will detect that we have
a directory a hard link count of 2 and we get a mount failure.
The errors and stack traces reported in dmesg/syslog are like this:

## AP-CVE-2025-68780 : CVE-2025-68780 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/deadline: only set free_cpus for online runqueues

Commit 16b269436b72 ("sched/deadline: Modify cpudl::free_cpus
to reflect rd->online") introduced the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu
functions to allow the cpu_dl::free_cpus mask to be manipulated
by the deadline scheduler class rq_on/offline callbacks so the
mask would also reflect this state.

Commit 9659e1eeee28 ("sched/deadline: Remove cpu_active_mask
from cpudl_find()") removed the check of the cpu_active_mask to
save some processing on the premise that the cpudl::free_cpus
mask already reflected the runqueue online state.

Unfortunately, there are cases where it is possible for the
cpudl_clear function to set the free_cpus bit for a CPU when the
deadline runqueue is offline. When this occurs while a CPU is
connected to the default root domain the flag may retain the bad
state after the CPU has been unplugged. Later, a different CPU
that is transitioning through the default root domain may push a
deadline task to the powered down CPU when cpudl_find sees its
free_cpus bit is set. If this happens the task will not have the
opportunity to run.

One example is outlined here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250110233010.2339521-1-opendmb@gmail.com

Another occurs when the last deadline task is migrated from a
CPU that has an offlined runqueue. The dequeue_task member of
the deadline scheduler class will eventually call cpudl_clear
and set the free_cpus bit for the CPU.

This commit modifies the cpudl_clear function to be aware of the
online state of the deadline runqueue so that the free_cpus mask
can be updated appropriately.

It is no longer necessary to manage the mask outside of the
cpudl_set/clear functions so the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu
functions are removed. In addition, since the free_cpus mask is
now only updated under the cpudl lock the code was changed to
use the non-atomic __cpumask functions.

## AP-CVE-2025-68781 : CVE-2025-68781 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: phy: fsl-usb: Fix use-after-free in delayed work during device removal

The delayed work item otg_event is initialized in fsl_otg_conf() and
scheduled under two conditions:
1. When a host controller binds to the OTG controller.
2. When the USB ID pin state changes (cable insertion/removal).

A race condition occurs when the device is removed via fsl_otg_remove():
the fsl_otg instance may be freed while the delayed work is still pending
or executing. This leads to use-after-free when the work function
fsl_otg_event() accesses the already freed memory.

The problematic scenario:

(detach thread)            | (delayed work)
fsl_otg_remove()           |
  kfree(fsl_otg_dev) //FREE| fsl_otg_event()
                           |   og = container_of(...) //USE
                           |   og-> //USE

Fix this by calling disable_delayed_work_sync() in fsl_otg_remove()
before deallocating the fsl_otg structure. This ensures the delayed work
is properly canceled and completes execution prior to memory deallocation.

This bug was identified through static analysis.

## AP-CVE-2025-68783 : CVE-2025-68783 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-mixer: us16x08: validate meter packet indices

get_meter_levels_from_urb() parses the 64-byte meter packets sent by
the device and fills the per-channel arrays meter_level[],
comp_level[] and master_level[] in struct snd_us16x08_meter_store.

Currently the function derives the channel index directly from the
meter packet (MUB2(meter_urb, s) - 1) and uses it to index those
arrays without validating the range. If the packet contains a
negative or out-of-range channel number, the driver may write past
the end of these arrays.

Introduce a local channel variable and validate it before updating the
arrays. We reject negative indices, limit meter_level[] and
comp_level[] to SND_US16X08_MAX_CHANNELS, and guard master_level[]
updates with ARRAY_SIZE(master_level).

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: openvswitch: fix middle attribute validation in push_nsh() action

The push_nsh() action structure looks like this:

 OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PUSH_NSH(OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH(OVS_NSH_KEY_ATTR_BASE,...))

The outermost OVS_ACTION_ATTR_PUSH_NSH attribute is OK'ed by the
nla_for_each_nested() inside __ovs_nla_copy_actions().  The innermost
OVS_NSH_KEY_ATTR_BASE/MD1/MD2 are OK'ed by the nla_for_each_nested()
inside nsh_key_put_from_nlattr().  But nothing checks if the attribute
in the middle is OK.  We don't even check that this attribute is the
OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH.  We just do a double unwrap with a pair of nla_data()
calls - first time directly while calling validate_push_nsh() and the
second time as part of the nla_for_each_nested() macro, which isn't
safe, potentially causing invalid memory access if the size of this
attribute is incorrect.  The failure may not be noticed during
validation due to larger netlink buffer, but cause trouble later during
action execution where the buffer is allocated exactly to the size:

Let's add some checks that the attribute is properly sized and it's
the only one attribute inside the action.  Technically, there is no
real reason for OVS_KEY_ATTR_NSH to be there, as we know that we're
pushing an NSH header already, it just creates extra nesting, but
that's how uAPI works today.  So, keeping as it is.

## AP-CVE-2025-68788 : CVE-2025-68788 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsnotify: do not generate ACCESS/MODIFY events on child for special files

inotify/fanotify do not allow users with no read access to a file to
subscribe to events (e.g. IN_ACCESS/IN_MODIFY), but they do allow the
same user to subscribe for watching events on children when the user
has access to the parent directory (e.g. /dev).

Users with no read access to a file but with read access to its parent
directory can still stat the file and see if it was accessed/modified
via atime/mtime change.

The same is not true for special files (e.g. /dev/null). Users will not
generally observe atime/mtime changes when other users read/write to
special files, only when someone sets atime/mtime via utimensat().

Align fsnotify events with this stat behavior and do not generate
ACCESS/MODIFY events to parent watchers on read/write of special files.
The events are still generated to parent watchers on utimensat(). This
closes some side-channels that could be possibly used for information
exfiltration [1].

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: fix a job->pasid access race in gpu recovery

Avoid a possible UAF in GPU recovery due to a race between
the sched timeout callback and the tdr work queue.

The gpu recovery function calls drm_sched_stop() and
later drm_sched_start().  drm_sched_start() restarts
the tdr queue which will eventually free the job.  If
the tdr queue frees the job before time out callback
completes, the job will be freed and we'll get a UAF
when accessing the pasid.  Cache it early to avoid the
UAF.

## AP-CVE-2025-68794 : CVE-2025-68794 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iomap: adjust read range correctly for non-block-aligned positions

iomap_adjust_read_range() assumes that the position and length passed in
are block-aligned. This is not always the case however, as shown in the
syzbot generated case for erofs. This causes too many bytes to be
skipped for uptodate blocks, which results in returning the incorrect
position and length to read in. If all the blocks are uptodate, this
underflows length and returns a position beyond the folio.

Fix the calculation to also take into account the block offset when
calculating how many bytes can be skipped for uptodate blocks.

## AP-CVE-2025-68795 : CVE-2025-68795 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethtool: Avoid overflowing userspace buffer on stats query

The ethtool -S command operates across three ioctl calls:
ETHTOOL_GSSET_INFO for the size, ETHTOOL_GSTRINGS for the names, and
ETHTOOL_GSTATS for the values.

If the number of stats changes between these calls (e.g., due to device
reconfiguration), userspace's buffer allocation will be incorrect,
potentially leading to buffer overflow.

Drivers are generally expected to maintain stable stat counts, but some
drivers (e.g., mlx5, bnx2x, bna, ksz884x) use dynamic counters, making
this scenario possible.

Some drivers try to handle this internally:
- bnad_get_ethtool_stats() returns early in case stats.n_stats is not
  equal to the driver's stats count.
- micrel/ksz884x also makes sure not to write anything beyond
  stats.n_stats and overflow the buffer.

However, both use stats.n_stats which is already assigned with the value
returned from get_sset_count(), hence won't solve the issue described
here.

Change ethtool_get_strings(), ethtool_get_stats(),
ethtool_get_phy_stats() to not return anything in case of a mismatch
between userspace's size and get_sset_size(), to prevent buffer
overflow.
The returned n_stats value will be equal to zero, to reflect that
nothing has been returned.

This could result in one of two cases when using upstream ethtool,
depending on when the size change is detected:
1. When detected in ethtool_get_strings():
    # ethtool -S eth2
    no stats available

2. When detected in get stats, all stats will be reported as zero.

Both cases are presumably transient, and a subsequent ethtool call
should succeed.

Other than the overflow avoidance, these two cases are very evident (no
output/cleared stats), which is arguably better than presenting
incorrect/shifted stats.
I also considered returning an error instead of a "silent" response, but
that seems more destructive towards userspace apps.

Notes:
- This patch does not claim to fix the inherent race, it only makes sure
  that we do not overflow the userspace buffer, and makes for a more
  predictable behavior.

- RTNL lock is held during each ioctl, the race window exists between
  the separate ioctl calls when the lock is released.

- Userspace ethtool always fills stats.n_stats, but it is likely that
  these stats ioctls are implemented in other userspace applications
  which might not fill it. The added code checks that it's not zero,
  to prevent any regressions.

## AP-CVE-2025-68797 : CVE-2025-68797 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

char: applicom: fix NULL pointer dereference in ac_ioctl

Discovered by Atuin - Automated Vulnerability Discovery Engine.

In ac_ioctl, the validation of IndexCard and the check for a valid
RamIO pointer are skipped when cmd is 6. However, the function
unconditionally executes readb(apbs[IndexCard].RamIO + VERS) at the
end.

If cmd is 6, IndexCard may reference a board that does not exist
(where RamIO is NULL), leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by skipping the readb access when cmd is 6, as this
command is a global information query and does not target a specific
board context.

## AP-CVE-2025-68799 : CVE-2025-68799 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

caif: fix integer underflow in cffrml_receive()

The cffrml_receive() function extracts a length field from the packet
header and, when FCS is disabled, subtracts 2 from this length without
validating that len >= 2.

If an attacker sends a malicious packet with a length field of 0 or 1
to an interface with FCS disabled, the subtraction causes an integer
underflow.

This can lead to memory exhaustion and kernel instability, potential
information disclosure if padding contains uninitialized kernel memory.

Fix this by validating that len >= 2 before performing the subtraction.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_mr: Fix use-after-free when updating multicast route stats

Cited commit added a dedicated mutex (instead of RTNL) to protect the
multicast route list, so that it will not change while the driver
periodically traverses it in order to update the kernel about multicast
route stats that were queried from the device.

One instance of list entry deletion (during route replace) was missed
and it can result in a use-after-free [1].

Fix by acquiring the mutex before deleting the entry from the list and
releasing it afterwards.

## AP-CVE-2025-68801 : CVE-2025-68801 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_router: Fix neighbour use-after-free

We sometimes observe use-after-free when dereferencing a neighbour [1].
The problem seems to be that the driver stores a pointer to the
neighbour, but without holding a reference on it. A reference is only
taken when the neighbour is used by a nexthop.

Fix by simplifying the reference counting scheme. Always take a
reference when storing a neighbour pointer in a neighbour entry. Avoid
taking a referencing when the neighbour is used by a nexthop as the
neighbour entry associated with the nexthop already holds a reference.

Tested by running the test that uncovered the problem over 300 times.
Without this patch the problem was reproduced after a handful of
iterations.

## AP-CVE-2025-68803 : CVE-2025-68803 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: NFSv4 file creation neglects setting ACL

An NFSv4 client that sets an ACL with a named principal during file
creation retrieves the ACL afterwards, and finds that it is only a
default ACL (based on the mode bits) and not the ACL that was
requested during file creation. This violates RFC 8881 section
6.4.1.3: "the ACL attribute is set as given".

The issue occurs in nfsd_create_setattr(), which calls
nfsd_attrs_valid() to determine whether to call nfsd_setattr().
However, nfsd_attrs_valid() checks only for iattr changes and
security labels, but not POSIX ACLs. When only an ACL is present,
the function returns false, nfsd_setattr() is skipped, and the
POSIX ACL is never applied to the inode.

Subsequently, when the client retrieves the ACL, the server finds
no POSIX ACL on the inode and returns one generated from the file's
mode bits rather than returning the originally-specified ACL.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

The smb2_set_ea function, which handles Extended Attributes (EA),
was performing buffer validation checks that incorrectly omitted the size
of the null terminating character (+1 byte) for EA Name.
This patch fixes the issue by explicitly adding '+ 1' to EaNameLength where
the null terminator is expected to be present in the buffer, ensuring
the validation accurately reflects the total required buffer size.

## AP-CVE-2025-68807 : CVE-2025-68807 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix race between wbt_enable_default and IO submission

When wbt_enable_default() is moved out of queue freezing in elevator_change(),
it can cause the wbt inflight counter to become negative (-1), leading to hung
tasks in the writeback path. Tasks get stuck in wbt_wait() because the counter
is in an inconsistent state.

The issue occurs because wbt_enable_default() could race with IO submission,
allowing the counter to be decremented before proper initialization. This manifests
as:

  rq_wait[0]:
    inflight:             -1
    has_waiters:        True

rwb_enabled() checks the state, which can be updated exactly between wbt_wait()
(rq_qos_throttle()) and wbt_track()(rq_qos_track()), then the inflight counter
will become negative.

And results in hung task warnings like:
  task:kworker/u24:39 state:D stack:0 pid:14767
  Call Trace:
    rq_qos_wait+0xb4/0x150
    wbt_wait+0xa9/0x100
    __rq_qos_throttle+0x24/0x40
    blk_mq_submit_bio+0x672/0x7b0
    ...

Fix this by:

1. Splitting wbt_enable_default() into:
   - __wbt_enable_default(): Returns true if wbt_init() should be called
   - wbt_enable_default(): Wrapper for existing callers (no init)
   - wbt_init_enable_default(): New function that checks and inits WBT

2. Using wbt_init_enable_default() in blk_register_queue() to ensure
   proper initialization during queue registration

3. Move wbt_init() out of wbt_enable_default() which is only for enabling
   disabled wbt from bfq and iocost, and wbt_init() isn't needed. Then the
   original lock warning can be avoided.

4. Removing the ELEVATOR_FLAG_ENABLE_WBT_ON_EXIT flag and its handling
   code since it's no longer needed

This ensures WBT is properly initialized before any IO can be submitted,
preventing the counter from going negative.

## AP-CVE-2025-68808 : CVE-2025-68808 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: vidtv: initialize local pointers upon transfer of memory ownership

vidtv_channel_si_init() creates a temporary list (program, service, event)
and ownership of the memory itself is transferred to the PAT/SDT/EIT
tables through vidtv_psi_pat_program_assign(),
vidtv_psi_sdt_service_assign(), vidtv_psi_eit_event_assign().

The problem here is that the local pointer where the memory ownership
transfer was completed is not initialized to NULL. This causes the
vidtv_psi_pmt_create_sec_for_each_pat_entry() function to fail, and
in the flow that jumps to free_eit, the memory that was freed by
vidtv_psi_*_table_destroy() can be accessed again by
vidtv_psi_*_event_destroy() due to the uninitialized local pointer, so it
is freed once again.

Therefore, to prevent use-after-free and double-free vulnerability,
local pointers must be initialized to NULL when transferring memory
ownership.

## AP-CVE-2025-68809 : CVE-2025-68809 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: vfs: fix race on m_flags in vfs_cache

ksmbd maintains delete-on-close and pending-delete state in
ksmbd_inode->m_flags. In vfs_cache.c this field is accessed under
inconsistent locking: some paths read and modify m_flags under
ci->m_lock while others do so without taking the lock at all.

Examples:

 - ksmbd_query_inode_status() and __ksmbd_inode_close() use
   ci->m_lock when checking or updating m_flags.
 - ksmbd_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_set_inode_pending_delete(),
   ksmbd_clear_inode_pending_delete() and ksmbd_fd_set_delete_on_close()
   used to read and modify m_flags without ci->m_lock.

This creates a potential data race on m_flags when multiple threads
open, close and delete the same file concurrently. In the worst case
delete-on-close and pending-delete bits can be lost or observed in an
inconsistent state, leading to confusing delete semantics (files that
stay on disk after delete-on-close, or files that disappear while still
in use).

Fix it by:

 - Making ksmbd_query_inode_status() look at m_flags under ci->m_lock
   after dropping inode_hash_lock.
 - Adding ci->m_lock protection to all helpers that read or modify
   m_flags (ksmbd_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_set_inode_pending_delete(),
   ksmbd_clear_inode_pending_delete(), ksmbd_fd_set_delete_on_close()).
 - Keeping the existing ci->m_lock protection in __ksmbd_inode_close(),
   and moving the actual unlink/xattr removal outside the lock.

This unifies the locking around m_flags and removes the data race while
preserving the existing delete-on-close behaviour.

## AP-CVE-2025-68810 : CVE-2025-68810 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: Disallow toggling KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on an existing memslot

Reject attempts to disable KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on a memslot that was
initially created with a guest_memfd binding, as KVM doesn't support
toggling KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD on existing memslots.  KVM prevents enabling
KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD, but doesn't prevent clearing the flag.

Failure to reject the new memslot results in a use-after-free due to KVM
not unbinding from the guest_memfd instance.  Unbinding on a FLAGS_ONLY
change is easy enough, and can/will be done as a hardening measure (in
anticipation of KVM supporting dirty logging on guest_memfd at some point),
but fixing the use-after-free would only address the immediate symptom.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: iris: Add sanity check for stop streaming

Add sanity check in iris_vb2_stop_streaming. If inst->state is
already IRIS_INST_ERROR, we should skip the stream_off operation
because it would still send packets to the firmware.

In iris_kill_session, inst->state is set to IRIS_INST_ERROR and
session_close is executed, which will kfree(inst_hfi_gen2->packet).
If stop_streaming is called afterward, it will cause a crash.

## AP-CVE-2025-68813 : CVE-2025-68813 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipvs: fix ipv4 null-ptr-deref in route error path

The IPv4 code path in __ip_vs_get_out_rt() calls dst_link_failure()
without ensuring skb->dev is set, leading to a NULL pointer dereference
in fib_compute_spec_dst() when ipv4_link_failure() attempts to send
ICMP destination unreachable messages.

The issue emerged after commit ed0de45a1008 ("ipv4: recompile ip options
in ipv4_link_failure") started calling __ip_options_compile() from
ipv4_link_failure(). This code path eventually calls fib_compute_spec_dst()
which dereferences skb->dev. An attempt was made to fix the NULL skb->dev
dereference in commit 0113d9c9d1cc ("ipv4: fix null-deref in
ipv4_link_failure"), but it only addressed the immediate dev_net(skb->dev)
dereference by using a fallback device. The fix was incomplete because
fib_compute_spec_dst() later in the call chain still accesses skb->dev
directly, which remains NULL when IPVS calls dst_link_failure().

The crash occurs when:
1. IPVS processes a packet in NAT mode with a misconfigured destination
2. Route lookup fails in __ip_vs_get_out_rt() before establishing a route
3. The error path calls dst_link_failure(skb) with skb->dev == NULL
4. ipv4_link_failure() → ipv4_send_dest_unreach() →
   __ip_options_compile() → fib_compute_spec_dst()
5. fib_compute_spec_dst() dereferences NULL skb->dev

Apply the same fix used for IPv6 in commit 326bf17ea5d4 ("ipvs: fix
ipv6 route unreach panic"): set skb->dev from skb_dst(skb)->dev before
calling dst_link_failure().

## AP-CVE-2025-68814 : CVE-2025-68814 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix filename leak in __io_openat_prep()

 __io_openat_prep() allocates a struct filename using getname(). However,
for the condition of the file being installed in the fixed file table as
well as having O_CLOEXEC flag set, the function returns early. At that
point, the request doesn't have REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP flag set. Due to this,
the memory for the newly allocated struct filename is not cleaned up,
causing a memory leak.

Fix this by setting the REQ_F_NEED_CLEANUP for the request just after the
successful getname() call, so that when the request is torn down, the
filename will be cleaned up, along with other resources needing cleanup.

## AP-CVE-2025-68815 : CVE-2025-68815 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: ets: Remove drr class from the active list if it changes to strict

Whenever a user issues an ets qdisc change command, transforming a
drr class into a strict one, the ets code isn't checking whether that
class was in the active list and removing it. This means that, if a
user changes a strict class (which was in the active list) back to a drr
one, that class will be added twice to the active list [1].

Doing so with the following commands:

tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1: ets bands 2 strict 1
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:2 handle 20: \
    tbf rate 8bit burst 100b latency 1s
tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:2

## AP-CVE-2025-68816 : CVE-2025-68816 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: fw_tracer, Validate format string parameters

Add validation for format string parameters in the firmware tracer to
prevent potential security vulnerabilities and crashes from malformed
format strings received from firmware.

The firmware tracer receives format strings from the device firmware and
uses them to format trace messages. Without proper validation, bad
firmware could provide format strings with invalid format specifiers
(e.g., %s, %p, %n) that could lead to crashes, or other undefined
behavior.

Add mlx5_tracer_validate_params() to validate that all format specifiers
in trace strings are limited to safe integer/hex formats (%x, %d, %i,
%u, %llx, %lx, etc.). Reject strings containing other format types that
could be used to access arbitrary memory or cause crashes.
Invalid format strings are added to the trace output for visibility with
"BAD_FORMAT: " prefix.

This reverts commit 0367076b0817d5c75dfb83001ce7ce5c64d803a9.

The commit being reverted added code to __qla2x00_abort_all_cmds() to
call sp->done() without holding a spinlock.  But unlike the older code
below it, this new code failed to check sp->cmd_type and just assumed
TYPE_SRB, which results in a jump to an invalid pointer in target-mode

Then commit 4475afa2646d ("scsi: qla2xxx: Complete command early within

rlen value is a user-controlled value, but dtv5100_i2c_msg() does not

## AP-CVE-2025-68821 : CVE-2025-68821 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: fix readahead reclaim deadlock

Commit e26ee4efbc79 ("fuse: allocate ff->release_args only if release is
needed") skips allocating ff->release_args if the server does not
implement open. However in doing so, fuse_prepare_release() now skips
grabbing the reference on the inode, which makes it possible for an
inode to be evicted from the dcache while there are inflight readahead
requests. This causes a deadlock if the server triggers reclaim while
servicing the readahead request and reclaim attempts to evict the inode
of the file being read ahead. Since the folio is locked during
readahead, when reclaim evicts the fuse inode and fuse_evict_inode()
attempts to remove all folios associated with the inode from the page
cache (truncate_inode_pages_range()), reclaim will block forever waiting
for the lock since readahead cannot relinquish the lock because it is
itself blocked in reclaim:

Fix this deadlock by allocating ff->release_args and grabbing the
reference on the inode when preparing the file for release even if the
server does not implement open. The inode reference will be dropped when
the last reference on the fuse file is dropped (see fuse_file_put() ->
fuse_release_end()).

## AP-CVE-2025-68822 : CVE-2025-68822 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: alps - fix use-after-free bugs caused by dev3_register_work

The dev3_register_work delayed work item is initialized within
alps_reconnect() and scheduled upon receipt of the first bare
PS/2 packet from an external PS/2 device connected to the ALPS
touchpad. During device detachment, the original implementation
calls flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() to ensure
completion of dev3_register_work. However, the flush_workqueue()
in psmouse_disconnect() only blocks and waits for work items that
were already queued to the workqueue prior to its invocation. Any
work items submitted after flush_workqueue() is called are not
included in the set of tasks that the flush operation awaits.
This means that after flush_workqueue() has finished executing,
the dev3_register_work could still be scheduled. Although the
psmouse state is set to PSMOUSE_CMD_MODE in psmouse_disconnect(),
the scheduling of dev3_register_work remains unaffected.

The race condition can occur as follows:

CPU 0 (cleanup path)     | CPU 1 (delayed work)
psmouse_disconnect()     |
  psmouse_set_state()    |
  flush_workqueue()      | alps_report_bare_ps2_packet()
  alps_disconnect()      |   psmouse_queue_work()
    kfree(priv); // FREE | alps_register_bare_ps2_mouse()
                         |   priv = container_of(work...); // USE
                         |   priv->dev3 // USE

Add disable_delayed_work_sync() in alps_disconnect() to ensure
that dev3_register_work is properly canceled and prevented from
executing after the alps_data structure has been deallocated.

This bug is identified by static analysis.

## AP-CVE-2025-68823 : CVE-2025-68823 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: fix deadlock when reading partition table

When one process(such as udev) opens ublk block device (e.g., to read
the partition table via bdev_open()), a deadlock[1] can occur:

1. bdev_open() grabs disk->open_mutex
2. The process issues read I/O to ublk backend to read partition table
3. In __ublk_complete_rq(), blk_update_request() or blk_mq_end_request()
   runs bio->bi_end_io() callbacks
4. If this triggers fput() on file descriptor of ublk block device, the
   work may be deferred to current task's task work (see fput() implementation)
5. This eventually calls blkdev_release() from the same context
6. blkdev_release() tries to grab disk->open_mutex again
7. Deadlock: same task waiting for a mutex it already holds

The fix is to run blk_update_request() and blk_mq_end_request() with bottom
halves disabled. This forces blkdev_release() to run in kernel work-queue
context instead of current task work context, and allows ublk server to make
forward progress, and avoids the deadlock.

## AP-CVE-2025-71064 : CVE-2025-71064 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: using the num_tqps in the vf driver to apply for resources

Currently, hdev->htqp is allocated using hdev->num_tqps, and kinfo->tqp
is allocated using kinfo->num_tqps. However, kinfo->num_tqps is set to
min(new_tqps, hdev->num_tqps);  Therefore, kinfo->num_tqps may be smaller
than hdev->num_tqps, which causes some hdev->htqp[i] to remain
uninitialized in hclgevf_knic_setup().

Thus, this patch allocates hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp using hdev->num_tqps,
ensuring that the lengths of hdev->htqp and kinfo->tqp are consistent
and that all elements are properly initialized.

## AP-CVE-2025-71066 : CVE-2025-71066 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: ets: Always remove class from active list before deleting in ets_qdisc_change

zdi-disclosures@trendmicro.com says:

The vulnerability is a race condition between `ets_qdisc_dequeue` and
`ets_qdisc_change`.  It leads to UAF on `struct Qdisc` object.
Attacker requires the capability to create new user and network namespace
in order to trigger the bug.
See my additional commentary at the end of the analysis.

Analysis:

static int ets_qdisc_change(struct Qdisc *sch, struct nlattr *opt,
                          struct netlink_ext_ack *extack)

	      //  freeing it
              qdisc_put(q->classes[i].qdisc);
	      // (5) If we call .dequeue between (4) and (5), we will have
	      // a strong UAF and we can control RIP
              q->classes[i].qdisc = NULL;

              memset(&q->classes[i].qstats, 0, sizeof(q->classes[i].qstats));
      }
      return 0;
}

Comment:
This happens because some of the classes have their qdiscs assigned to
NULL, but remain in the active list. This commit fixes this issue by always
removing the class from the active list before deleting and freeing its
associated qdisc

## AP-CVE-2025-71067 : CVE-2025-71067 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntfs: set dummy blocksize to read boot_block when mounting

When mounting, sb->s_blocksize is used to read the boot_block without
being defined or validated. Set a dummy blocksize before attempting to
read the boot_block.

The issue can be triggered with the following syz reproducer:

  mkdirat(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000080)='./file1\x00', 0x0)
  r4 = openat$nullb(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000040), 0x121403, 0x0)
  ioctl$FS_IOC_SETFLAGS(r4, 0x40081271, &(0x7f0000000980)=0x4000)
  mount(&(0x7f0000000140)=@nullb, &(0x7f0000000040)='./cgroup\x00',
        &(0x7f0000000000)='ntfs3\x00', 0x2208004, 0x0)
  syz_clone(0x88200200, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)

Here, the ioctl sets the bdev block size to 16384. During mount,
get_tree_bdev_flags() calls sb_set_blocksize(sb, block_size(bdev)),
but since block_size(bdev) > PAGE_SIZE, sb_set_blocksize() leaves
sb->s_blocksize at zero.

Later, ntfs_init_from_boot() attempts to read the boot_block while
sb->s_blocksize is still zero, which triggers the bug.

## AP-CVE-2025-71069 : CVE-2025-71069 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: invalidate dentry cache on failed whiteout creation

F2FS can mount filesystems with corrupted directory depth values that
get runtime-clamped to MAX_DIR_HASH_DEPTH. When RENAME_WHITEOUT
operations are performed on such directories, f2fs_rename performs
directory modifications (updating target entry and deleting source
entry) before attempting to add the whiteout entry via f2fs_add_link.

If f2fs_add_link fails due to the corrupted directory structure, the
function returns an error to VFS, but the partial directory
modifications have already been committed to disk. VFS assumes the
entire rename operation failed and does not update the dentry cache,
leaving stale mappings.

In the error path, VFS does not call d_move() to update the dentry
cache. This results in new_dentry still pointing to the old inode
(new_inode) which has already had its i_nlink decremented to zero.
The stale cache causes subsequent operations to incorrectly reference
the freed inode.

This causes subsequent operations to use cached dentry information that
no longer matches the on-disk state. When a second rename targets the
same entry, VFS attempts to decrement i_nlink on the stale inode, which
may already have i_nlink=0, triggering a WARNING in drop_nlink().

Example sequence:
1. First rename (RENAME_WHITEOUT): file2 → file1
   - f2fs updates file1 entry on disk (points to inode 8)
   - f2fs deletes file2 entry on disk
   - f2fs_add_link(whiteout) fails (corrupted directory)
   - Returns error to VFS
   - VFS does not call d_move() due to error
   - VFS cache still has: file1 → inode 7 (stale!)
   - inode 7 has i_nlink=0 (already decremented)

2. Second rename: file3 → file1
   - VFS uses stale cache: file1 → inode 7
   - Tries to drop_nlink on inode 7 (i_nlink already 0)
   - WARNING in drop_nlink()

Fix this by explicitly invalidating old_dentry and new_dentry when
f2fs_add_link fails during whiteout creation. This forces VFS to
refresh from disk on subsequent operations, ensuring cache consistency
even when the rename partially succeeds.

Reproducer:
1. Mount F2FS image with corrupted i_current_depth
2. renameat2(file2, file1, RENAME_WHITEOUT)
3. renameat2(file3, file1, 0)
4. System triggers WARNING in drop_nlink()

## AP-CVE-2025-71070 : CVE-2025-71070 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: clean up user copy references on ublk server exit

If a ublk server process releases a ublk char device file, any requests
dispatched to the ublk server but not yet completed will retain a ref
value of UBLK_REFCOUNT_INIT. Before commit e63d2228ef83 ("ublk: simplify
aborting ublk request"), __ublk_fail_req() would decrement the reference
count before completing the failed request. However, that commit
optimized __ublk_fail_req() to call __ublk_complete_rq() directly
without decrementing the request reference count.
The leaked reference count incorrectly allows user copy and zero copy
operations on the completed ublk request. It also triggers the
WARN_ON_ONCE(refcount_read(&io->ref)) warnings in ublk_queue_reinit()
and ublk_deinit_queue().
Commit c5c5eb24ed61 ("ublk: avoid ublk_io_release() called after ublk
char dev is closed") already fixed the issue for ublk devices using
UBLK_F_SUPPORT_ZERO_COPY or UBLK_F_AUTO_BUF_REG. However, the reference
count leak also affects UBLK_F_USER_COPY, the other reference-counted
data copy mode. Fix the condition in ublk_check_and_reset_active_ref()
to include all reference-counted data copy modes. This ensures that any
ublk requests still owned by the ublk server when it exits have their
reference counts reset to 0.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/mediatek: fix use-after-free on probe deferral

The driver is dropping the references taken to the larb devices during
probe after successful lookup as well as on errors. This can
potentially lead to a use-after-free in case a larb device has not yet
been bound to its driver so that the iommu driver probe defers.

Fix this by keeping the references as expected while the iommu driver is
bound.

## AP-CVE-2025-71072 : CVE-2025-71072 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

shmem: fix recovery on rename failures

maple_tree insertions can fail if we are seriously short on memory;
simple_offset_rename() does not recover well if it runs into that.
The same goes for simple_offset_rename_exchange().

Moreover, shmem_whiteout() expects that if it succeeds, the caller will
progress to d_move(), i.e. that shmem_rename2() won't fail past the
successful call of shmem_whiteout().

Not hard to fix, fortunately - mtree_store() can't fail if the index we
are trying to store into is already present in the tree as a singleton.

For simple_offset_rename_exchange() that's enough - we just need to be
careful about the order of operations.

For simple_offset_rename() solution is to preinsert the target into the
tree for new_dir; the rest can be done without any potentially failing
operations.

That preinsertion has to be done in shmem_rename2() rather than in
simple_offset_rename() itself - otherwise we'd need to deal with the
possibility of failure after successful shmem_whiteout().

## AP-CVE-2025-71073 : CVE-2025-71073 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: lkkbd - disable pending work before freeing device

lkkbd_interrupt() schedules lk->tq via schedule_work(), and the work
handler lkkbd_reinit() dereferences the lkkbd structure and its
serio/input_dev fields.

lkkbd_disconnect() and error paths in lkkbd_connect() free the lkkbd
structure without preventing the reinit work from being queued again
until serio_close() returns. This can allow the work handler to run
after the structure has been freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.

Use disable_work_sync() instead of cancel_work_sync() to ensure the
reinit work cannot be re-queued, and call it both in lkkbd_disconnect()
and in lkkbd_connect() error paths after serio_open().

## AP-CVE-2025-71074 : CVE-2025-71074 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

functionfs: fix the open/removal races

ffs_epfile_open() can race with removal, ending up with file->private_data
pointing to freed object.

There is a total count of opened files on functionfs (both ep0 and
dynamic ones) and when it hits zero, dynamic files get removed.
Unfortunately, that removal can happen while another thread is
in ffs_epfile_open(), but has not incremented the count yet.
In that case open will succeed, leaving us with UAF on any subsequent
read() or write().

The root cause is that ffs->opened is misused; atomic_dec_and_test() vs.
atomic_add_return() is not a good idea, when object remains visible all
along.

To untangle that
	* serialize openers on ffs->mutex (both for ep0 and for dynamic files)
	* have dynamic ones use atomic_inc_not_zero() and fail if we had
zero ->opened; in that case the file we are opening is doomed.
	* have the inodes of dynamic files marked on removal (from the
callback of simple_recursive_removal()) - clear ->i_private there.
	* have open of dynamic ones verify they hadn't been already removed,
along with checking that state is FFS_ACTIVE.

## AP-CVE-2025-71078 : CVE-2025-71078 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/64s/slb: Fix SLB multihit issue during SLB preload

On systems using the hash MMU, there is a software SLB preload cache that
mirrors the entries loaded into the hardware SLB buffer. This preload
cache is subject to periodic eviction — typically after every 256 context
switches — to remove old entry.

To optimize performance, the kernel skips switch_mmu_context() in
switch_mm_irqs_off() when the prev and next mm_struct are the same.
However, on hash MMU systems, this can lead to inconsistencies between
the hardware SLB and the software preload cache.

If an SLB entry for a process is evicted from the software cache on one
CPU, and the same process later runs on another CPU without executing
switch_mmu_context(), the hardware SLB may retain stale entries. If the
kernel then attempts to reload that entry, it can trigger an SLB
multi-hit error.

The following timeline shows how stale SLB entries are created and can
cause a multi-hit error when a process moves between CPUs without a
MMU context switch.

Thread B (nfc_unregister_device):
  nfc_unregister_device()
    device_lock(&dev->dev)
      rfkill_unregister()
        mutex_lock(&rfkill_global_mutex)  <- waits for rfkill_global_mutex

This creates a classic ABBA deadlock scenario.

Fix this by moving rfkill_unregister() and rfkill_destroy() outside the
device_lock critical section. Store the rfkill pointer in a local variable
before releasing the lock, then call rfkill_unregister() after releasing
device_lock.

This change is safe because rfkill_fop_write() holds rfkill_global_mutex
while calling the rfkill callbacks, and rfkill_unregister() also acquires
rfkill_global_mutex before cleanup. Therefore, rfkill_unregister() will
wait for any ongoing callback to complete before proceeding, and
device_del() is only called after rfkill_unregister() returns, preventing
any use-after-free.

The similar lock ordering in nfc_register_device() (device_lock ->
rfkill_global_mutex via rfkill_register) is safe because during
registration the device is not yet in rfkill_list, so no concurrent
rfkill operations can occur on this device.

## AP-CVE-2025-71080 : CVE-2025-71080 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: fix a BUG in rt6_get_pcpu_route() under PREEMPT_RT

On PREEMPT_RT kernels, after rt6_get_pcpu_route() returns NULL, the
current task can be preempted. Another task running on the same CPU
may then execute rt6_make_pcpu_route() and successfully install a
pcpu_rt entry. When the first task resumes execution, its cmpxchg()
in rt6_make_pcpu_route() will fail because rt6i_pcpu is no longer
NULL, triggering the BUG_ON(prev). It's easy to reproduce it by adding
mdelay() after rt6_get_pcpu_route().

Using preempt_disable/enable is not appropriate here because
ip6_rt_pcpu_alloc() may sleep.

Fix this by handling the cmpxchg() failure gracefully on PREEMPT_RT:
free our allocation and return the existing pcpu_rt installed by
another task. The BUG_ON is replaced by WARN_ON_ONCE for non-PREEMPT_RT
kernels where such races should not occur.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: stm32: sai: fix OF node leak on probe

The reference taken to the sync provider OF node when probing the
platform device is currently only dropped if the set_sync() callback
fails during DAI probe.

Make sure to drop the reference on platform probe failures (e.g. probe
deferral) and on driver unbind.

This also avoids a potential use-after-free in case the DAI is ever
reprobed without first rebinding the platform driver.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btusb: revert use of devm_kzalloc in btusb

This reverts commit 98921dbd00c4e ("Bluetooth: Use devm_kzalloc in
btusb.c file").

In btusb_probe(), we use devm_kzalloc() to allocate the btusb data. This
ties the lifetime of all the btusb data to the binding of a driver to
one interface, INTF. In a driver that binds to other interfaces, ISOC
and DIAG, this is an accident waiting to happen.

The issue is revealed in btusb_disconnect(), where calling
usb_driver_release_interface(&btusb_driver, data->intf) will have devm
free the data that is also being used by the other interfaces of the
driver that may not be released yet.

To fix this, revert the use of devm and go back to freeing memory
explicitly.

## AP-CVE-2025-71085 : CVE-2025-71085 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: BUG() in pskb_expand_head() as part of calipso_skbuff_setattr()

There exists a kernel oops caused by a BUG_ON(nhead < 0) at
net/core/skbuff.c:2232 in pskb_expand_head().
This bug is triggered as part of the calipso_skbuff_setattr()
routine when skb_cow() is passed headroom > INT_MAX
(i.e. (int)(skb_headroom(skb) + len_delta) < 0).

The root cause of the bug is due to an implicit integer cast in
__skb_cow(). The check (headroom > skb_headroom(skb)) is meant to ensure
that delta = headroom - skb_headroom(skb) is never negative, otherwise
we will trigger a BUG_ON in pskb_expand_head(). However, if
headroom > INT_MAX and delta <= -NET_SKB_PAD, the check passes, delta
becomes negative, and pskb_expand_head() is passed a negative value for
nhead.

Fix the trigger condition in calipso_skbuff_setattr(). Avoid passing
"negative" headroom sizes to skb_cow() within calipso_skbuff_setattr()
by only using skb_cow() to grow headroom.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: rose: fix invalid array index in rose_kill_by_device()

rose_kill_by_device() collects sockets into a local array[] and then
iterates over them to disconnect sockets bound to a device being brought
down.

The loop mistakenly indexes array[cnt] instead of array[i]. For cnt <
ARRAY_SIZE(array), this reads an uninitialized entry; for cnt ==
ARRAY_SIZE(array), it is an out-of-bounds read. Either case can lead to
an invalid socket pointer dereference and also leaks references taken
via sock_hold().

Fix the index to use i.

## AP-CVE-2025-71087 : CVE-2025-71087 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iavf: fix off-by-one issues in iavf_config_rss_reg()

There are off-by-one bugs when configuring RSS hash key and lookup
table, causing out-of-bounds reads to memory [1] and out-of-bounds
writes to device registers.

Before commit 43a3d9ba34c9 ("i40evf: Allow PF driver to configure RSS"),
the loop upper bounds were:
    i <= I40E_VFQF_{HKEY,HLUT}_MAX_INDEX
which is safe since the value is the last valid index.

That commit changed the bounds to:
    i <= adapter->rss_{key,lut}_size / 4
where `rss_{key,lut}_size / 4` is the number of dwords, so the last
valid index is `(rss_{key,lut}_size / 4) - 1`. Therefore, using `<=`
accesses one element past the end.

Fix the issues by using `<` instead of `<=`, ensuring we do not exceed
the bounds.

The TCP subflow can process the simult-connect syn-ack packet after
transitioning to TCP_FIN1 state, bypassing the MPTCP fallback check,
as the sk_state_change() callback is not invoked for * -> FIN_WAIT1
transitions.

That will move the msk socket to an inconsistent status and the next
incoming data will hit the reported splat.

Close the race moving the simult-fallback check at the earliest possible
stage - that is at syn-ack generation time.

This proposes a fix for a security vulnerability related to IOMMU Shared
Virtual Addressing (SVA).  In an SVA context, an IOMMU can cache kernel
page table entries.  When a kernel page table page is freed and
reallocated for another purpose, the IOMMU might still hold stale,
incorrect entries.  This can be exploited to cause a use-after-free or
write-after-free condition, potentially leading to privilege escalation or
data corruption.

This solution introduces a deferred freeing mechanism for kernel page
table pages, which provides a safe window to notify the IOMMU to
invalidate its caches before the page is reused.


This patch (of 8):

In the IOMMU Shared Virtual Addressing (SVA) context, the IOMMU hardware
shares and walks the CPU's page tables.  The x86 architecture maps the
kernel's virtual address space into the upper portion of every process's
page table.  Consequently, in an SVA context, the IOMMU hardware can walk
and cache kernel page table entries.

The Linux kernel currently lacks a notification mechanism for kernel page
table changes, specifically when page table pages are freed and reused. 
The IOMMU driver is only notified of changes to user virtual address
mappings.  This can cause the IOMMU's internal caches to retain stale
entries for kernel VA.

Use-After-Free (UAF) and Write-After-Free (WAF) conditions arise when
kernel page table pages are freed and later reallocated.  The IOMMU could
misinterpret the new data as valid page table entries.  The IOMMU might
then walk into attacker-controlled memory, leading to arbitrary physical
memory DMA access or privilege escalation.  This is also a
Write-After-Free issue, as the IOMMU will potentially continue to write
Accessed and Dirty bits to the freed memory while attempting to walk the
stale page tables.

Currently, SVA contexts are unprivileged and cannot access kernel
mappings.  However, the IOMMU will still walk kernel-only page tables all
the way down to the leaf entries, where it realizes the mapping is for the
kernel and errors out.  This means the IOMMU still caches these
intermediate page table entries, making the described vulnerability a real
concern.

Disable SVA on x86 architecture until the IOMMU can receive notification
to flush the paging cache before freeing the CPU kernel page table pages.

## AP-CVE-2025-71090 : CVE-2025-71090 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfsd_file reference leak in nfsd4_add_rdaccess_to_wrdeleg()

nfsd4_add_rdaccess_to_wrdeleg() unconditionally overwrites
fp->fi_fds[O_RDONLY] with a newly acquired nfsd_file. However, if
the client already has a SHARE_ACCESS_READ open from a previous OPEN
operation, this action overwrites the existing pointer without
releasing its reference, orphaning the previous reference.

Additionally, the function originally stored the same nfsd_file
pointer in both fp->fi_fds[O_RDONLY] and fp->fi_rdeleg_file with
only a single reference. When put_deleg_file() runs, it clears
fi_rdeleg_file and calls nfs4_file_put_access() to release the file.

However, nfs4_file_put_access() only releases fi_fds[O_RDONLY] when
the fi_access[O_RDONLY] counter drops to zero. If another READ open
exists on the file, the counter remains elevated and the nfsd_file
reference from the delegation is never released. This potentially
causes open conflicts on that file.

Then, on server shutdown, these leaks cause __nfsd_file_cache_purge()
to encounter files with an elevated reference count that cannot be
cleaned up, ultimately triggering a BUG() in kmem_cache_destroy()
because there are still nfsd_file objects allocated in that cache.

## AP-CVE-2025-71092 : CVE-2025-71092 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix OOB write in bnxt_re_copy_err_stats()

Commit ef56081d1864 ("RDMA/bnxt_re: RoCE related hardware counters
update") added three new counters and placed them after
BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR.

BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR acts as a boundary marker for allocating hardware
statistics with different num_counters values on chip_gen_p5_p7 devices.

As a result, BNXT_RE_NUM_STD_COUNTERS are used when allocating
hw_stats, which leads to an out-of-bounds write in
bnxt_re_copy_err_stats().

The counters BNXT_RE_REQ_CQE_ERROR, BNXT_RE_RESP_CQE_ERROR, and
BNXT_RE_RESP_REMOTE_ACCESS_ERRS are applicable to generic hardware, not
only p5/p7 devices.

Fix this by moving these counters before BNXT_RE_OUT_OF_SEQ_ERR so they
are included in the generic counter set.

This happens because the TBI check unconditionally dereferences the last

Fix by rejecting the frame early if the length is zero, or if it exceeds
adapter->rx_buffer_len. This preserves the TBI workaround semantics for
valid frames and prevents touching memory beyond the RX buffer.

For XDP_TX action, the xdp_buff is converted to xdp_frame by
xdp_convert_buff_to_frame(). The memory type of the resulting xdp_frame
depends on the memory type of the xdp_buff. For page pool based xdp_buff
it produces xdp_frame with memory type MEM_TYPE_PAGE_POOL. For zero copy
XSK pool based xdp_buff it produces xdp_frame with memory type
MEM_TYPE_PAGE_ORDER0. However, stmmac_xdp_xmit_back() does not check the
memory type and always uses the page pool type, this leads to invalid
mappings and causes the crash. Therefore, check the xdp_buff memory type
in stmmac_xdp_xmit_back() to fix this issue.

Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/core: Check for the presence of LS_NLA_TYPE_DGID correctly

The netlink response for RDMA_NL_LS_OP_IP_RESOLVE should always have a
LS_NLA_TYPE_DGID attribute, it is invalid if it does not.

Use the nl parsing logic properly and call nla_parse_deprecated() to fill
the nlattrs array and then directly index that array to get the data for
the DGID. Just fail if it is NULL.

Remove the for loop searching for the nla, and squash the validation and
parsing into one function.

Fixes an uninitialized read from the stack triggered by userspace if it
does not provide the DGID to a kernel initiated RDMA_NL_LS_OP_IP_RESOLVE
query.

## AP-CVE-2025-71097 : CVE-2025-71097 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv4: Fix reference count leak when using error routes with nexthop objects

When a nexthop object is deleted, it is marked as dead and then
fib_table_flush() is called to flush all the routes that are using the
dead nexthop.

The current logic in fib_table_flush() is to only flush error routes
(e.g., blackhole) when it is called as part of network namespace
dismantle (i.e., with flush_all=true). Therefore, error routes are not
flushed when their nexthop object is deleted:

 # ip link add name dummy1 up type dummy
 # ip nexthop add id 1 dev dummy1
 # ip route add 198.51.100.1/32 nhid 1
 # ip route add blackhole 198.51.100.2/32 nhid 1
 # ip nexthop del id 1
 # ip route show
 blackhole 198.51.100.2 nhid 1 dev dummy1

As such, they keep holding a reference on the nexthop object which in
turn holds a reference on the nexthop device, resulting in a reference
count leak:

 # ip link del dev dummy1
 [   70.516258] unregister_netdevice: waiting for dummy1 to become free. Usage count = 2

Fix by flushing error routes when their nexthop is marked as dead.

IPv6 does not suffer from this problem.

## AP-CVE-2025-71098 : CVE-2025-71098 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ip6_gre: make ip6gre_header() robust

Over the years, syzbot found many ways to crash the kernel
in ip6gre_header() [1].

This involves team or bonding drivers ability to dynamically
change their dev->needed_headroom and/or dev->hard_header_len

In this particular crash mld_newpack() allocated an skb
with a too small reserve/headroom, and by the time mld_sendpack()
was called, syzbot managed to attach an ip6gre device.

## AP-CVE-2025-71099 : CVE-2025-71099 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/oa: Fix potential UAF in xe_oa_add_config_ioctl()

In xe_oa_add_config_ioctl(), we accessed oa_config->id after dropping
metrics_lock. Since this lock protects the lifetime of oa_config, an
attacker could guess the id and call xe_oa_remove_config_ioctl() with
perfect timing, freeing oa_config before we dereference it, leading to
a potential use-after-free.

Fix this by caching the id in a local variable while holding the lock.

v2: (Matt A)
- Dropped mutex_unlock(&oa->metrics_lock) ordering change from
  xe_oa_remove_config_ioctl()

## AP-CVE-2025-71101 : CVE-2025-71101 Exploitation
Description: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: hp-bioscfg: Fix out-of-bounds array access in ACPI package parsing

The hp_populate_*_elements_from_package() functions in the hp-bioscfg
driver contain out-of-bounds array access vulnerabilities.

These functions parse ACPI packages into internal data structures using
a for loop with index variable 'elem' that iterates through
enum_obj/integer_obj/order_obj/password_obj/string_obj arrays.

When processing multi-element fields like PREREQUISITES and
ENUM_POSSIBLE_VALUES, these functions read multiple consecutive array
elements using expressions like 'enum_obj[elem + reqs]' and
'enum_obj[elem + pos_values]' within nested loops.

The bug is that the bounds check only validated elem, but did not consider
the additional offset when accessing elem + reqs or elem + pos_values.

The fix changes the bounds check to validate the actual accessed index.

## AP-CVE-2026-21265 : CVE-2026-21265 Exploitation
Description: Windows Secure Boot stores Microsoft certificates in the UEFI KEK and DB. These original certificates are approaching expiration, and devices containing affected certificate versions must update them to maintain Secure Boot functionality and avoid compromising security by losing security fixes related to Windows boot manager or Secure Boot.
The operating system’s certificate update protection mechanism relies on firmware components that might contain defects, which can cause certificate trust updates to fail or behave unpredictably. This leads to potential disruption of the Secure Boot trust chain and requires careful validation and deployment to restore intended security guarantees.

## AP-CVE-2025-68271 : CVE-2025-68271 Exploitation
Description: OpenC3 COSMOS provides the functionality needed to send commands to and receive data from one or more embedded systems. From 5.0.0 to 6.10.1, OpenC3 COSMOS contains a critical remote code execution vulnerability reachable through the JSON-RPC API. When a JSON-RPC request uses the string form of certain APIs, attacker-controlled parameter text is parsed into values using String#convert_to_value. For array-like inputs, convert_to_value executes eval(). Because the cmd code path parses the command string before calling authorize(), an unauthenticated attacker can trigger Ruby code execution even though the request ultimately fails authorization (401). This vulnerability is fixed in 6.10.2.

## AP-CVE-2025-68949 : CVE-2025-68949 Exploitation
Description: n8n is an open source workflow automation platform. From 1.36.0 to before 2.2.0, the Webhook node’s IP whitelist validation performed partial string matching instead of exact IP comparison. As a result, an incoming request could be accepted if the source IP address merely contained the configured whitelist entry as a substring. This issue affected instances where workflow editors relied on IP-based access controls to restrict webhook access. Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were impacted. An attacker with a non-whitelisted IP could bypass restrictions if their IP shared a partial prefix with a trusted address, undermining the intended security boundary. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.2.0.

## AP-CVE-2026-22817 : CVE-2026-22817 Exploitation
Description: Hono is a Web application framework that provides support for any JavaScript runtime. Prior to 4.11.4, there is a flaw in Hono’s JWK/JWKS JWT verification middleware allowed the JWT header’s alg value to influence signature verification when the selected JWK did not explicitly specify an algorithm. This could enable JWT algorithm confusion and, in certain configurations, allow forged tokens to be accepted. As part of this fix, the JWT middleware now requires the alg option to be explicitly specified. This prevents algorithm confusion by ensuring that the verification algorithm is not derived from untrusted JWT header values. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.11.4.

## AP-CVE-2026-22686 : CVE-2026-22686 Exploitation
Description: Enclave is a secure JavaScript sandbox designed for safe AI agent code execution. Prior to 2.7.0, there is a critical sandbox escape vulnerability in enclave-vm that allows untrusted, sandboxed JavaScript code to execute arbitrary code in the host Node.js runtime. When a tool invocation fails, enclave-vm exposes a host-side Error object to sandboxed code. This Error object retains its host realm prototype chain, which can be traversed to reach the host Function constructor. An attacker can intentionally trigger a host error, then climb the prototype chain. Using the host Function constructor, arbitrary JavaScript can be compiled and executed in the host context, fully bypassing the sandbox and granting access to sensitive resources such as process.env, filesystem, and network. This breaks enclave-vm’s core security guarantee of isolating untrusted code. This vulnerability is fixed in 2.7.0.
